    "text":"The history of The United Methodist Church includes God's self-revelation and action in history through the call of Abraham, the Hebrew exodus from Egypt, and especially the incarnation, life, death, and resurrection of God's Word Jesus Christ, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. The United Methodist Church shares this history with the whole church, as contained in the canonical Scriptures.\nIn the early 1500s, various reform movements emerged in Western Europe that created forms of western Christianity not in communion with the Roman Catholic pope. These became known as Protestantism. They emphasized a return to the sources of faith: that is, God's action in salvation and Scripture as the authority for doctrine and practice. Different contexts and visions produced Lutheran, Reformed, Anabaptist, and Anglican Protestantism, all of which influenced the traditions that came together in United Methodism.\nDuring the late 1600s, a renewal movement, often referred to as Pietism, emerged in Europe. Broadly conceived, the movement emphasized the Christian experience of new birth, sanctifica\u00ad tion, the possibility of societal transformation, and small groups. The movement affected most confessions including Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican, and Anabaptist. Expressions of this move\u00ad ment included the philanthropic and mission work of August Hermann Franke in Germany, the growth of Moravianism under the leadership of Ludwig von Zinzendorf, the Religious Socie\u00ad ties Movement begun by Anthony Horneck in England, as well as Reformed and more radical groups."

    "text":"All Wesleyan and Methodist Christians are connected to the lives and ministries of John Wesley (1703-1791) and his brother, Charles (1707-1788). Both John and Charles were Church of Eng\u00ad land priests who volunteered as missionaries to the colony of Georgia, arriving in March, 1736. Their mission was far from an unqualified success, and both returned to England disillusioned and discouraged, Charles in December, 1736, and John in Febru\u00ad ary, 1738.\nThe Wesley brothers had transforming religious experiences in May, 1738, under the influence of Moravian missionaries. John's experience on May 24 of that year at a Moravian meeting on Aldersgate Street, London, has a prominent place in the Church's memory. Shortly thereafter, both brothers began preaching a mes\u00ad sage of new birth and sanctification in Anglican religious societies and outdoors to whomever would listen. They also established missional and philanthropic enterprises to promote social change. The goal of this movement was to \"reform the nation, particu\u00ad larly the church; and to spread scriptural holiness over the land.\" Over time a pattern of organization and discipline emerged. It included a set of General Rules, societies made up of class meet\u00ad ings (small groups in which members of Methodist societies watched over one another), and band meetings (smaller confes\u00ad sional groups divided by gender), all connected by traveling lay preachers."

    "text":"Methodism in America began without authorization or sup\u00ad port from England, as lay Methodists immigrated to America. Among its earliest leaders were Robert Strawbridge, an immigrant farmer who organized work in Maryland and Virginia around 1760; Philip Embury and his cousin Barbara Heck, who began work in New York in 1766; and Captain Thomas Webb, whose labors were instrumental in Methodist beginnings in Philadelphia in 1767. The first Methodist societies included active participation by people of European and African descent.\nTo strengthen the Methodist work in the colonies, John Wesley sent two lay preachers, Richard Boardman and Joseph Pilmore, to America in 1769. Two years later, Richard Wright and Francis Asbury were dispatched to undergird the growing American Methodist societies. Asbury became the most impor\u00ad tant figure in early American Methodism. His energetic devotion to the principles of Wesleyan theology, ministry, and organization shaped Methodism in America in ways unmatched by any other individual.\nThe first conference of Methodist preachers in the colonies was held in Philadelphia in 1773. The ten who attended pledged allegiance to Wesley's leadership and agreed that, as laypeople, they would not administer the sacraments. Methodists would receive the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper at a local Anglican parish church. They emphasized strong discipline among the societies and preachers. A system of regular confer\u00ad ences was inaugurated, similar to those Wesley had instituted in England to conduct the business of the Methodist movement.\nThe American Revolution profoundly impacted Methodism. John Wesley's loyalty to the king and his writings against the rev\u00ad olutionary cause did not enhance the image of Methodism among many who supported independence. Furthermore, a number of Methodist preachers refused to bear arms to aid the patriots.\nWhen independence from England was won, Wesley recog\u00ad nized that changes were necessary for American Methodism to thrive. He sent Thomas Coke to America to superintend the work with Asbury. Coke brought with him a prayer book entitled The Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America, prepared by Wesley and incorporating his revision of the Church of England's Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion. Richard Whatcoat and Thomas Vasey, whom Wesley had ordained, accompanied Coke. Wesley's ordinations set a precedent that ultimately permitted Methodists in America to become an independent church."

    "text":"In December 1784, the famous Christmas Conference of preachers was held in Baltimore at Lovely Lane Chapel. Most of the American preachers attended, probably including African Americans, Harry Hosier and Richard Allen. At this gathering the movement became organized as The Methodist Episcopal Church in America. In the following years The Methodist Epis\u00ad copal Church published its first Discipline (1785), adopted a qua\u00ad drennial General Conference, the first of which was held in 1792, and drafted a Constitution (1808). It also established a publish\u00ad ing house and became a proponent of revivalism and the camp meeting.\nTwo other churches were forming in America, which, in their earliest years were composed almost entirely of German-speak\u00ad ing people. The first was founded by Philip William Otterbein (1726-1813) and Martin Boehm (1725-1812). Otterbein, a German Reformed pastor, and Boehm, a Mennonite, preached an evan\u00ad gelical message similar to the Methodists. In 1800, their followers formally organized the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, which included a similar organization of traveling preachers. Otterbein attended the Christmas Conference and participated in Asbury's ordination.\nA second church, The Evangelical Association, was begun by Jacob Albright (1759-1808). Albright, a Lutheran farmer and tile-maker in eastern Pennsylvania, was converted by the United Brethren and nurtured in a Methodist class meeting. He later established his own connection of preachers, better to reach fel\u00ad low German-speakers. The Evangelical Association was officially organized in 1803.\nEarly attempts at merging these churches failed. By the time of Asbury's death in March 1816, Otterbein, Boehm, and Albright had also died. The churches they nurtured had survived and were beginning to expand numerically and geographically. The Ger\u00ad man churches united in 1946 as The Evangelical United Brethren Church, which in turn joined with The Methodist Church in 1968 to form The United Methodist Church."

    "text":"The Second Great Awakening was the dominant religious development among Protestants in America during the first half of the nineteenth century. Through revivals and camp meetings, sinners experienced conversion. Circuit-riding preachers and lay pastors knit them into a connection. This style of Christian faith and discipline was very agreeable to Methodists, United Brethren, and Evangelicals who favored its emphasis on the experiential. The memberships of these churches increased dramatically, as did the number of preachers serving them.\nPreachers and laity were expected to be seriously committed to both the faith and mission. Preachers were to possess a sound conversion and divine calling, as well as to demonstrate gifts and skills for fruitful ministry. The financial benefits were meager. The general membership's commitment was exhibited in their will\u00ad ingness to submit to the discipline of their churches. Methodists, for example, were strictly guided by the General Rules adopted at the Christmas Conference of 1784 and still included in United Methodism's Book of Discipline. They were urged to avoid evil, do good, and use the means of grace supplied by God. Those who did not adhere to the Discipline were to be removed from membership.\nThe structure of Methodist, United Brethren, and Evangelical Association churches allowed them to function in ways to sup\u00ad port, consolidate, and expand their ministries. Local classes could spring up wherever a few women and men were gathered under the direction of a class leader. The itinerant preacher, who had a circuit of appointments under his care, visited regularly. This sys\u00ad tem served the diverse needs of city, town, or frontier outpost. The churches could go to the people wherever they settled. Annual conferences under episcopal leadership provided the mechanism for admitting and ordaining clergy, appointing itinerant preach\u00ad ers to their churches, and supplying them with mutual support. General Conferences, meeting quadrennially, proved sufficient to set the main course for the church, including the creation of the Discipline by which it was governed.\nThe Methodist Book Concern, organized in 1789, was the first church publishing house in America. The Evangelical Association and United Brethren also authorized the formation of publish\u00ad ing agencies in the early nineteenth century. From these presses came a succession of hymnals, Disciplines, newspapers, tracts, and magazines. Profits were usually designated for the support and welfare of retired and indigent preachers and their families.<p>\n\n<pt>Revival and Growth, 1817-1843<\/pt>\n<p>The founding period was not without serious problems, espe\u00ad cially for the Methodists. Conflict between Methodism's struc\u00ad ture and values and American cultural norms (especially over episcopacy, race, and slavery) sometimes led to schism. In 1792, James O'Kelly founded the Republican Methodists to reduce the authority of bishops. Richard Allen (1760-1831), an emancipated slave and Methodist preacher who was mistreated because of his race, left the church and in 1816 organized The African Meth\u00ad odist Episcopal Church. For similar reasons, The African Meth\u00ad odist Episcopal Zion Church was begun in 1821. In 1830, about 5,000 preachers and laypeople left the denomination because it would not grant representation to the laity or permit the election of presiding elders (district superintendents). This new body was called The Methodist Protestant Church, which in 1939 united\nwith The Methodist Episcopal Church and The Methodist Epis\u00ad copal Church, South, to become The Methodist Church. In 1843, abolitionist preachers Orange Scott and Luther Lee formed the Wesleyan Methodist Church over Methodism's weakening prohi\u00ad bition against slaveholding.\nEven with these tensions, Methodism spread to new cultures and overseas. African American Methodist preacher, John Stew\u00ad art, began an unauthorized mission to the Wyandot Indians in Ohio in 1815, which was adopted by the Ohio Conference in 1819. Another African American preacher, Daniel Coker, who had been ordained by Asbury and participated in the organizing confer\u00ad ence of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, was among the eighty-eight emigrants who sailed to Africa in 1820, assisted by the American Colonization Society. While still at sea he organized a church. The group landed in what is today Liberia. Missionary work in Africa was carried out mainly by lay people until 1833, when Melville Beveridge Cox became the first missionary of the Methodist Episcopal Church appointed to Liberia.\nOther institutions also developed. By 1841, Methodists, Evan\u00ad gelicals, and United Brethren had all begun denominational mis\u00ad sionary societies. Sunday schools were encouraged in every place where they could be started and maintained. Interest in education was also evident in the establishment of secondary schools and colleges. By 1845, each had instituted courses of study for their preachers to ensure that they had a basic knowledge of the Bible, theology, and pastoral ministry."

    "text":"John Wesley had been an ardent opponent of slavery. In 1789, the General Rules were officially adopted by American Method\u00ad ism. A rule forbidding participation in slavery, which had not been deemed necessary in England, was included. But as Method\u00ad ism expanded, that prohibition was relaxed or not enforced where slavery was legal. Because membership spanned regions, classes, and races, contention over slavery ultimately split Methodism into separate northern and southern churches.\nAt the 1844 General Conference, pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions clashed over episcopacy, race, and slavery. Their most serious conflict concerned one of the church's five bishops, James 0. Andrew, who had acquired slaves through marriage. After acri\u00admonious debate, the General Conference voted to suspend Bishop Andrew from the exercise of his office so long as he could not, or would not, free his slaves. A few days later, dissidents drafted a Plan of Separation, which permitted the annual conferences in slaveholding states to separate from The Methodist Episcopal Church in order to organize their own ecclesiastical structure. The Plan of Separation was adopted and the groundwork laid for the creation of The Methodist Episcopal Church, South.\nDelegates from the southern states met in Louisville, Ken\u00ad tucky, in May 1845, to organize their new church. Their first General Conference was held the following year in Petersburg, Virginia, where a Discipline and hymnbook were adopted. The Methodist Protestant Church was also affected by the slavery controversy, splitting in 1858 and reuniting in 1877. The United Brethren and The Evangelical Association, being concentrated in northern states, were able to avoid the passionate struggle that fractured The Methodist Episcopal Church.<p>\n\n<pt>Division in America and Expansion Overseas, 1844-1860<\/pt>\n<p>Despite conflict and division in America, Methodism con\u00ad tinued to expand overseas. In 1847, Judson D. Collins, Moses C. White, and his wife Jane Isabel Altwater landed in Fuzhou, China, under the auspices of the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Despite a slow beginning, the Missionary Soci\u00ad ety gained valuable lessons that enabled Robert S. Maclay to enter Japan in 1873. In 1885, William B. Scranton, his mother Mary F. Scranton, and Henry G. Appenzeller began work in Korea. Amer\u00ad ican Methodists also set their sights on South Asia. In 1856, Wil\u00ad liam Butler landed in Kolkata with his wife, Clementina Rowe Butler (one of the future founders of Woman's Foreign Missionary Society), and two of their children.\nEuropean Methodism also began, as migrants, sailors, sol\u00ad diers, and others who encountered Methodism outside of Europe shared the message back home. Ludwig Jacoby joined the Meth\u00ad odists after immigrating to Cincinnati in 1838. He returned to Germany in 1849 and began gathering a church in Bremen. The Evangelical Association, with ethnic and linguistic links to Ger\u00ad many, sent Conrad Link as its first official missionary to Germany in 1850. Norwegian seaman Ole Peter Petersen, after hearing Methodists in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1845, preached to Norwegians and Danes in America and Norway in 1849. The first congregation in Denmark was established by Christian Willerup in 1856."

    "text":"Bitterness between northern and southern Methodists had intensified in the years leading to Abraham Lincoln's election in 1860 and then through the carnage of the Civil War. Each church claimed divine sanction for its region and prayed fervently for God's will to be accomplished in victory for its side.\nThe Civil War devastated The Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Its churches lay in ruins or were seriously damaged. Many of its clergy were killed or wounded, and its educational, publish\u00ad ing, and missionary programs were disrupted. African American membership declined significantly during and after the war. In 1870, the General Conference voted to transfer all remaining Afri\u00ad can Americans to a new church. The Colored Methodist Episcopal Church (now The Christian Methodist Episcopal Church) resulted. The Methodist Episcopal Church, Methodist Protestants, United Brethren, and Evangelicals also lost preachers and members but did not suffer the same economic loss as southern Methodism.\nThe period from the Civil War to World War I saw growth in membership for all branches of Methodism, Evangelicals, and United Brethren. The value of church property increased dra\u00ad matically, Sunday schools were strengthened through increased training of teachers, and publishing houses maintained ambitious programs to furnish members with literature. Higher educational standards for the clergy were cultivated, and theological semi\u00ad naries were founded. The period was also marked by theological developments and controversies. The holiness movement, which emphasized a Christian's experience of entire sanctification, together with the rise of liberal theology and the Social Gospel Movement, were sources of conflict.\nRural and poorer segments of the church, especially those associated with the holiness movement, were skeptical of prestige and affluence. A Methodist preacher, Benjamin Titus Roberts, had formed the Free Methodist Church in 1860 to oppose worldliness, especially the grand middle class churches in cities financed by renting pews. In 1895, the Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene (now the Nazarene Church) was formed under the encourage\u00ad ment of Phineas Bresee, a Methodist Episcopal preacher, presid\u00ad ing elder, and delegate to the General Conferences of 1872 and 1892. The goal for the new denomination, founded in 1894, was to have churches furnished to welcome the poor where holiness was preached.\nTwo other issues that caused substantial debate in the churches during this period were lay representation and the role of women. Methodist Protestants had granted the laity represen\u00ad tation from the time they organized in 1830. The clergy in The Methodist Episcopal Church, The Methodist Episcopal Church, South, The Evangelical Association, and the Church of the United Brethren in Christ were much slower in permitting laity an official voice. It was not until 1932 that the last of these churches allowed lay representation."

    "text":"Even more contentious was the question of women's ordina\u00ad tion and eligibility for lay offices and representation in the church. Women had been ordained in holiness denominations as early as the 1860s, and the United Brethren General Conference approved ordination for women in 1889. However, The Methodist Episcopal Church and The Methodist Episcopal Church, South, did not ordain women until well after their reunion in 1939.1 The Evangelical Asso\u00ad ciation never ordained women. Lay representation for women was also resisted. Women were not admitted as delegates to the Gen\u00ad eral Conferences of The Methodist Protestant Church until 1892, the United Brethren until 1893, The Methodist Episcopal Church until 1904, and The Methodist Episcopal Church, South, until 1922.\nMission work continued to rise on the agendas of the churches. Women formed missionary societies beginning in 1869 to educate, recruit, and raise funds for these endeavors. Mission\u00ad aries like Isabella Thoburn, Susan Bauernfeind, and Harriett Brit\u00ad tan, and administrators like Bell Harris Bennett and Lucy Rider Meyer, motivated thousands of church women to support home and foreign missions.\nDomestic mission programs sought to Christianize the city. Home missionaries established schools for former slaves and their children. In 1871, the southern Methodist church ordained Alejo Hernandez, making him the first Hispanic preacher ordained in Methodism, although Benigno Cardenas had preached in Span\u00ad ish in Santa Fe, New Mexico, as early as 1853. Significant Meth\u00ad odist ministries among Asian Americans were instituted during this period, especially among Chinese and Japanese immigrants. A Japanese layman, Kanichi Miyama, was ordained in California in 1887.\nMethodism continued to expand in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. From 1870 to 1875 Methodist missionaries embarked on revival campaigns in India south of the Ganges River under the leadership of James M. Thoburn, and the famous holiness evangelist William Taylor. These efforts gave birth to the South India Conference in 1876. Thoburn also began work in Southeast Asia when he opened mission work in Rangoon, Burma (Myanmar), in 1879. In 1885, he led the establishment of Meth\u00ad odist work in Singapore, which later expanded into the Malaya Peninsular and Sarawak to become the Malaysia Annual Confer\u00ad ence in 1902. The conference also sent the first Methodist pastor to Indonesia in 1905. Methodism reached the Philippines when Thoburn organized work in Manila in 1899, which quickly grew to become the Philippine Islands Annual Conference in 1908.\nAt the Methodist Episcopal General Conference of 1884, a petition from the Liberia Conference was presented, asking for a resident bishop in Africa. William Taylor was elected to the episco\u00ad pacy as missionary bishop to Africa. Taylor went with two specific assignments: overseeing Liberia and expanding missions on the African continent. Between May 20 and September 10, 1885, the Methodist Episcopal Church founded five strategic points to start their work in Angola. In 1886, the bishop and his party entered the Lower Congo. Taylor also visited the king of Portugal in 1886 and received permission to do mission work in Portuguese East Africa (Mozambique). Taylor established self-supporting churches in southern Liberia, Sierra Leone, Angola, in what is today Mozam\u00ad bique, and in Zaire. In 1896, Joseph Crane Hartzell was elected Bishop for Africa, and by 1897 the Methodist Episcopal Church reached Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). During this period, annual confer\u00ad ences other than those in the United States were organized region\u00ad ally into what was termed central conferences."

    "text":"In the years prior to World War I, the Methodist Episcopal Church demonstrated its concern for social issues by adopting a Social Creed at its 1908 General Conference. Social problems were also a spur in the movement toward ecumenism and interchurch cooperation. Each of the denominations now included in The United Methodist Church became active in the Federal Council of Churches, the first major ecumenical venture among Ameri\u00ad can Protestants. There was also much sympathy in the churches\nfor negotiation and arbitration as an alternative to international armed conflict. Many church members and clergy openly pro\u00ad fessed pacifism. When the United Sates officially entered the war in 1917, pacifism faded as American patriotism was identified with the war effort.\nAfter the war, the churches returned their energies to social change. One of their perennial concerns was temperance, and they were quick to recognize it among their highest priorities. They published and distributed large amounts of temperance lit\u00ad erature. Members pledged that they would abstain from alcoholic beverages.\nThere was significant theological ferment during this period. Biblical fundamentalists and neo-orthodox theologians ques\u00ad tioned liberal Protestant theology and accused it of undermin\u00ad ing the very essence of the Christian message. Since each of these theological parties-fundamentalist, neo-orthodox, and liberal\u00ad waswell represented among the forerunners of United Method\u00ad ism, heated doctrinal disputes were present in these churches.\nDespite internal theological strife, the churches continued to cooperate with other denominations and acted to heal earlier schisms. A division that had occurred in The Evangelical Associa\u00ad tion in 1894 was repaired in 1922, when two factions united as The Evangelical Church.\nA numerically larger union took place among three Meth\u00ad odist bodies-The Methodist Episcopal Church, The Methodist Protestant Church, and The Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Representatives of these churches began meeting in 1916 to forge a plan of union. By the 1930s, their proposal included partition\u00ad ing the united church into six administrative units called juris\u00ad dictions. Five of these were geographical; the sixth, the Central Jurisdiction, was racial, including African American churches and annual conferences wherever they were geographically located in the United States. African American Methodists and some others were troubled by this prospect and opposed the plan. The major\u00ad ity of Methodist Protestants favored the union, even though it meant episcopal government, which they had not had since their church was organized in 1830. Following overwhelming approv\u00ad als at the General Conferences and annual conferences of the three churches, they were united in April, 1939, into The Methodist Church. At the time of its formation, the new church included 7.7 million members.\nConflict in Europe was heating up again. Although Method\u00ad ists, Evangelicals, and United Brethren each had published strong statements condemning war and advocating peaceful reconcilia\u00ad tion among the nations, once again the strength of their positions was largely lost with American involvement in the hostilities of World War II."

    "text":"As the war ended, the churches actively worked to secure world peace and order. Many laity, pastors, bishops, and church agencies supported the establishment of a world organization to serve as a forum for the resolution of international social, eco\u00ad nomic, and political problems. In April 1945, their labors contrib\u00ad uted to the founding of the United Nations.\nDuring this era, there were at least three other important mat\u00ad ters that occupied the attention of the churches that now compose United Methodism. First, they maintained their concern for ecu\u00ad menism and church union. On November 16, 1946, in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, The Evangelical Church and The United Brethren Church were united into The Evangelical United Brethren Church following twenty years of negotiation. At the time of union, the new church included about 700,000 members.\nThe Methodist Church was also interested in closer ties with other Methodist and Wesleyan bodies. In 1951, it participated in the formation of the World Methodist Council, successor to the Ecumenical Methodist Conferences that began in 1881. Method\u00ad ists and the Evangelical United Brethren became active mem\u00ad bers of the World Council of Churches, founded in 1948, and the National Council of Churches, founded in 1950. The two churches also cooperated with seven other Protestant denominations in forming the Consultation of Church Union in 1960.\nSecond, the churches demonstrated growing uneasiness with the problem of racism in both the nation and the church. Many Methodists were especially disturbed by the manner in which racial segregation was built into the fabric of their denominational structure. The Central Jurisdiction was a constant reminder of racial discrimination. Proposals to eliminate the Central Jurisdic\u00ad tion were introduced at General Conferences from 1956 to 1966. Finally, plans to abolish the Central Jurisdiction were agreed upon with the contemplated union with the Evangelical United\nBrethren in 1968, although a few African American annual confer\u00ad ences continued for a short time thereafter.\nThird, the churches debated women's ordination. The issue was critical in the creation of The Evangelical United Brethren Church. The Evangelical Church had never ordained women. The United Brethren had ordained women since 1889. In order to facilitate the union of these two churches, the United Breth\u00ad ren accepted the Evangelical practice, and women's ordination was stopped. Methodists debated the issue for several years after their unification in 1939. The Methodist Church began ordain\u00ad ing women in 1956. In that same year, women were granted full clergy rights and could be elected as members in full connection to an annual conference."

    "text":"In 1968, The Evangelical United Brethren Church and The Methodist Church united. Full clergy status for women was included in the plan of union. Since then, an increasing number of women have been admitted to the ordained ministry, appointed to the district superintendency, elected to positions of denomina\u00ad tional leadership, and consecrated as bishops. In 1980, Marjorie Matthews was the first woman elected to the Church's episcopacy.\nWhen The United Methodist Church was created in 1968, it had approximately 11 million members, making it one of the larg\u00ad est Protestant churches in the world. Since then the church has become increasingly aware of itself as a world church with mem\u00ad bership and conferences in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the United States. While worldwide membership in The United Methodist Church has grown since 1968, membership in Europe and the United States has declined, offset by significant growth in Africa and Asia. In Africa, The United Methodist Church has expanded episcopal areas to include East Africa, Sierra Leone, Cote d'Ivoire, East Congo, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and South Africa.\nChanges in worship style, the rise of the charismatic move\u00ad ment, the growth of nondenominationalism, and the emergence of megachurches have all challenged the church as it entered its third century. Most trying, The United Methodist Church has had to negotiate cultural shifts with regard to gender and sexuality, especially in the United States and Europe. Conflicts over homo\u00ad sexuality, marriage, and abortion have continued uninterrupted nearly since the formation of the denomination. These debates\nhave opened up large domestic, international, and ecumenical rifts over the church's doctrine and discipline.\nThe United Methodist Church continues to represent the con\u00ad fluence of three streams of tradition: Methodism, the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, and The Evangelical Association. With other churches that are also members of the body of Christ, it humbly and gratefully offers up its praise to God through Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit for creating and sustaining grace. It seeks further grace as it ministers to the world."

It is the redeemed and redeeming fellowship in which the Word of God is preached by persons divinely called, and the sacraments are duly administered according to Christ's own appointment. Under the discipline of the Holy Spirit the church seeks to provide for the maintenance of worship, the edifi\u00ad cation of believers, and the redemption of the world.\nThe church of Jesus Christ exists in and for the world, and its very dividedness is a hindrance to its mission in that world.\nThe prayers and intentions of The United Methodist Church and its predecessors, The Methodist Church and The Evangelical United Brethren Church, have been and are for obedience to the will of our Lord that his people be one, in humility for the present brokenness of the Church and in gratitude that opportunities for reunion have been given.\nTherefore, The United Methodist Church has adopted and amended the following Constitution. The Constitution was adopted in Chicago, Illinois, on Nov. 11, 1966, by the General Conferences of The Evangelical United Brethren Church and The Methodist Church and thereafter by the requisite vote in the annual conferences of the two churches. The Plan of Union was made effective by the Uniting Conference in Dallas, Texas, on April 23, 1968. Preamble (Amended 2000)."

We are a worldwide denomination united by doctrine, discipline, and mission through our connectional covenant. The General Book of Discipline expresses that unity. Each central, jurisdictional, or regional conference may make changes and adaptations to the General Book of Discipline to more fruitfully accomplish our mis\u00ad sion in various contexts. However, some portions of the General Book of Discipline are not subject to adaptation. The following parts and paragraphs are not subject to change or adaptation except by action of the General Conference. The Standing Committee on Central Conference Matters has primary responsibility for proposing \u00adto General Conference revisions to this paragraph. The Standing Committee on Central Conference Matters, in consultation with the Committee on Faith and Order, will bring legislation to the next regular General Conference to change the structure of the General Book of Discipline to include a Part VI, Gen\u00ad eral Organization and Administration not subject to change or adap\u00ad tation by central conferences, and such Part VI may include the creation of new material particularly on theological and missional components, and a Part VII, Additional Organization and Administra\u00ad tion, adaptable by central conferences. This new Part VII may also include the creation of new material, especially language to enable the paragraphs to flow together. The content of Part VI of the 2020\/2024 Book of Discipline will be included in either Part VI or Part VII of the forthcoming General Book of Discipline. For the work on Part VI, Chapter 2 (The Ministry of the Ordained) and Chapter 3 (The Superintendency) of the 2020\/2024 Book of Disci\u00ad pline, the Standing Committee on Central Conference Matters will work in consultation with the Commission for the Study of Minis\u00adtry, if such Commission is created for the 2025-2028 quadrennium following the postponed 2020 General Conference, and for Part VI, Chapter 5 (Administrative Order) of the 2020\/2024 Book of Disci\u00ad pline, the Standing Committee on Central Conference Matters will work in consultation with the Connectional Table to create a new Part VI which reflects the theological and missional components of agency and expresses what is essential wherever United Method\u00ad ism exists, and a new Part VII accordingly. In accordance with the Book of Discipline, the Connectional Table will support the collaborative efforts of the general agencies as they develop disci\u00ad plinary language that specifically describes the agencies' work in a way that reflects the theological and missional components of agency. This collaborative effort of the Connectional Table will be carried out in partnership with the Standing Committee on Cen\u00ad tral Conference Matters, which will submit legislation on Part VI and Part VII to the next regular General Conference.

    "text":"United Methodists share a common heritage with Christians of every age and nation. This heritage is grounded in the apostolic witness to Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord, which is the source and measure of all valid Christian teaching.\nFaced with diverse interpretations of the apostolic message, leaders of the early church sought to specify the core of Christian belief in order to ensure the soundness of Christian teaching. The determination of the canon of Christian Scripture and the adoption of ecumenical creeds such as the formulations of Nicaea and Chalcedon were of central importance to this consensual pro\u00adcess. Such creeds helped preserve the integrity of the church's witness, set boundaries for acceptable Christian doctrine, and proclaimed the basic elements of the enduring Christian message. These statements of faith, along with the Apostles' Creed, contain the most prominent features of our ecumenical heritage. The Protestant reformers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries devised new confessional statements that reiterated classical Christian teaching in an attempt to recover the authentic biblical witness. These documents affirmed the primacy of Scrip\u00ad ture and provided formal doctrinal standards through their state\u00ad ments of essential beliefs on matters such as the way of salvation, the Christian life, and the nature of the church.\nMany distinctively Protestant teachings were transmitted into United Methodist understandings through doctrinal formulations such as the Articles of Religion of the Church of England and the Heidelberg Catechism of the Reformed tradition. Various doctrinal statements in the form of creeds, confessions of belief, and articles of faith were officially adopted by churches as standards of Christian teaching. Notwithstanding their impor\u00adtance, these formal doctrinal standards by no means exhausted authoritative Christian teaching. The standards themselves initially emerged from a much wider body of Christian thought and practice, and their fuller sig\u00ad nificance unfolded in the writings of the church's teachers. Some writings have proved simply to be dated benchmarks in the story of the church's continuing maturation. Bycontrast, some sermons, treatises, liturgies, and hymns have gained considerable practical authority in the life and thought of the church by virtue of their wide and continuing acceptance as faithful expositions of Christian teaching. Nonetheless, the basic measure of authenticity in doctrinal standards, whether formally established or received by tradition, has been their fidelity to the apostolic faith grounded in Scripture and evidenced in the life of the church through the centuries."

    "text":"With Christians of other communions we confess belief in the triune God-Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This confession embraces the biblical witness to God's activity in creation, encom\u00ad passes God's gracious self-involvement in the dramas of history, and anticipates the consummation of God's reign. The created order is designed for the well-being of all crea\u00ad tures and as the place of human dwelling in covenant with God. As sinful creatures, however, we have broken that covenant, become estranged from God, wounded ourselves and one another, and wreaked havoc throughout the natural order. We stand in need of redemption. We hold in common with all Christians a faith in the mys\u00ad tery of salvation in and through Jesus Christ. At the heart of the gospel of salvation is God's incarnation in Jesus of Nazareth. Scripture witnesses to the redeeming love of God in Jesus' life and teachings, his atoning death, his resurrection, his sovereign pres\u00ad ence in history, his triumph over the powers of evil and death, and his promised return. Because God truly loves us in spite of our willful sin, God judges us, summons us to repentance, pardons us, receives us by that grace given to us in Jesus Christ, and gives us hope of life eternal. We share the Christian belief that God's redemptive love is realized in human life by the activity of the Holy Spirit, both in personal experience and in the community of believers. This community is the church, which the Spirit has brought into exis\u00ad tence for the healing of the nations. Through faith in Jesus Christ we are forgiven, reconciled to God, and transformed as people of the new covenant. \"Life in the Spirit\" involves diligent use of the means of grace such as praying, fasting, attending upon the sacraments, and inward searching in solitude. It also encompasses the communal life of the church in worship, mission, evangelism, service, and social witness. We understand ourselves to be part of Christ's universal church when by adoration, proclamation, and service we become conformed to Christ. We are initiated and incorporated into this community of faith by baptism, receiving the promise of the Spirit that re-creates and transforms us. Through the regular celebration of Holy Communion, we participate in the risen presence of Jesus Christ and are thereby nourished for faithful discipleship. We pray and work for the coming of God's realm and reign to the world and rejoice in the promise of everlasting life that over\u00ad comes death and the forces of evil. With other Christians we recognize that the reign of God is both a present and future reality. The church is called to be that place where the first signs of the reign of God are identified and acknowledged in the world. Wherever persons are being made new creatures in Christ, wherever the insights and resources of the gospel are brought to bear on the life of the world, God's reign is already effective in its healing and renewing power. We also look to the end time in which God's work will be fulfilled. This prospect gives us hope in our present actions as individuals and as the Church. This expectation saves us from resignation and motivates our continuing witness and service."

With other Christians, we declare the essential oneness of the church in Christ Jesus. This rich heritage of shared Christian belief finds expression in our hymnody and liturgies. Our unity is affirmed in the historic creeds as we confess one holy, catholic, and apostolic church. It is also experienced in joint ventures of ministry and in various forms of ecumenical cooperation. Nourished by common roots of this shared Christian heritage, the branches of Christ's church have developed diverse traditions that enlarge our store of shared understandings. Our avowed ecu\u00ad menical commitment as United Methodists is to gather our own doctrinal emphases into the larger Christian unity, there to be made more meaningful in a richer whole. If we are to offer our best gifts to the common Christian treasury, we must make a deliberate effort as a church to strive for critical self-understanding. It is as Christians involved in ecumenical partnership that we embrace and examine our dis\u00ad tinctive heritage."

Early Methodists claimed to preach the scriptural doctrines of the Church of England as contained in the Articles of Religion, the Homilies, and the Book of Common Prayer.\nTheir task was not to reformulate doctrine. Their tasks were to summon people to experience the justifying and sanctifying grace of God and encourage people to grow in the knowledge and love of God through the personal and corporate disciplines of the Christian life.\nThe thrust of the Wesleyan movement and of the United Brethren and Evangelical Association was \"to reform the nation, particularly the Church, and to spread scriptural holiness over the land.\"\nWesley's orientation toward the practical is evident in his focus upon the \"scripture way of salvation.\" He considered doc\u00ad trinal matters primarily in terms of their significance for Christian discipleship.\nThe Wesleyan emphasis upon the Christian life-faith and love put into practice-has been the hallmark of those traditions now incorporated into The United Methodist Church. The dis\u00adtinctive shape of the Wesleyan theological heritage can be seen in a constellation of doctrinal emphases that display the creating, redeeming, and sanctifying activity of God."

The Evangelical United Brethren tradi\u00ad tion, particularly as expressed by Phillip William Otterbein from a Reformed background, gave similar distinctive emphases.\nGrace pervades our understanding of Christian faith and life. By grace we mean the undeserved, unmerited, and loving action of God in human existence through the ever-present Holy Spirit. While the grace of God is undivided, it precedes salvation as \"pre\u00ad venient grace,\" continues in \"justifying grace,\" and is brought to fruition in \"sanctifying grace.\"\nWe assert that God's grace is manifest in all creation even though suffering, violence, and evil are everywhere present. The goodness of creation is fulfilled in human beings, who are called to covenant partnership with God. God has endowed us with dig\u00ad nity and freedom and has summoned us to responsibility for our lives and the life of the world.\nIn God's self-revelation, Jesus Christ, we see the splendor of our true humanity. Even our sin, with its destructive consequences for all creation, does not alter God's intention for us-holiness and happiness of heart. Nor does it diminish our accountability for the way we live.\nDespite our brokenness, we remain creatures brought into being by a just and merciful God.

This righting of relationships by God through Christ calls forth our faith and trust as we experience regeneration, by which we are made new creatures in Christ.\nThis process of justification and new birth is often referred to as conversion. Such a change may be sudden and dramatic, or gradual and cumulative. It marks a new beginning, yet it is part of an ongoing process. Christian experience as personal transforma\u00ad tion always expresses itself as faith working by love.\nOur Wesleyan theology also embraces the scriptural promise that we can expect to receive assurance of our present salvation as the Spirit \"bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.\"<\/p> \n\n\n<pn>102<\/pn> <pt>SECTION 1 OUR DOCTRINAL HERITAGE<\/pt> \n<spt>Distinctive Wesleyan Emphases<\/spt>\n<sptt>Sanctification and Perfection<sptt> <p>We hold that the wonder of God's acceptance and pardon does not end God's saving work, which continues to nurture our growth in grace.

Methodists have always been strictly enjoined to maintain the unity of faith and good works through the means of grace, as seen in John Wesley's Nature, Design, and General Rules of the United Societies (1743). The coherence of faith with ministries of love forms the discipline of Wesleyan spirituality and Christian discipleship.\nThe General Rules were originally designed for members of Methodist societies who participated in the sacramental life of the Church of England. The terms of membership in these societies were simple: \"a desire to flee from the wrath to come and to be saved from their sins.\"\nWesley insisted, however, that evangelical faith should mani\u00ad fest itself in evangelical living. He spelled out this expectation in the three-part formula of the Rules:\n\"It is therefore expected of all who continue therein that they should continue to evidence their desire of salvation,\n\"First: By doing no harm, by avoiding evil of every kind ... ; \"Secondly: By ... doing good of every possible sort, and, as far as possible, to all; \"Thirdly: By attending upon all the ordinances of God\".\nWesley's illustrative cases under each of these three rules show how the Christian conscience might move from general principles to specific actions. Their explicit combination high\u00ad lights the spiritual spring of moral action.\nWesley rejected undue reliance upon these rules. Discipline was not church law; it was a way of discipleship. Wesley insisted that true religion is \"the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus,\" \"the life which is hid with Christ in God,\" and \"the righteousness that [the true believer] thirsts after.\""

In asserting the connection between doctrine and ethics, the General Rules provide an early signal of Methodist social consciousness.\nThe Social Principles provide our most recent official summary of stated convictions that seek to apply the Christian vision of righteousness to social, economic, and political issues. Our historic opposition to evils such as smuggling, inhu\u00ad mane prison conditions, slavery, drunkenness, and child labor was founded upon a vivid sense of God's wrath against human injustice and wastage.\nOur struggles for human dignity and social reform have been a response to God's demand for love, mercy, and justice in the light of the Kingdom. We proclaim no personal gospel that fails to express itself in relevant social concerns; we proclaim no social gos\u00ad pel that does not include the personal transformation of sinners.\nIt is our conviction that the good news of the Kingdom must judge, redeem, and reform the sinful social structures of our time. The Book of Discipline and the General Rules convey the expec\u00ad tation of discipline within the experience of individuals and the life of the Church. Such discipline assumes accountability to the community of faith by those who claim that community's support. Support without accountability promotes moral weakness; accountability without support is a form of cruelty.\nA church that rushes to punishment is not open to God's mercy, but a church lacking the courage to act decisively on per\u00ad sonal and social issues loses its claim to moral authority. The church exercises its discipline as a community through which God continues to \"reconcile the world to himself.\""

    "text":"The pioneers in the traditions that flowed together into The United Methodist Church understood themselves as standing in the central stream of Christian spirituality and doctrine, loyal heirs of the authentic Christian tradition. In John Wesley's words, theirs was \"the old religion, the religion of the Bible, the religion ... of the whole church in the purest ages.\" Their gospel was grounded in the biblical message of God's self-giving love revealed in Jesus Christ.\nWesley's portrayal of the spiritual pilgrimage in terms of \"the scripture way of salvation\" provided their model for experien\u00ad tial Christianity. They assumed and insisted upon the integrity of basic Christian truth and emphasized its practical application in the lives of believers.\nThis perspective is apparent in the Wesleyan understanding of \"catholic spirit.\" While it is true that United Methodists are fixed upon certain religious affirmations, grounded in the gospel and confirmed in their experience, they also recognize the right of Christians to disagree on matters such as forms of worship, structures of church government, modes of baptism, or theologi\u00ad cal explorations. They believe such differences do not break the bond of fellowship that ties Christians together in Jesus Christ. Wesley's familiar dictum was, \"As to all opinions which do not strike at the root of Christianity, we think and let think.\"\nBut, even as they were fully committed to the principles of religious toleration and theological diversity, they were equally confident that there is a \"marrow\" of Christian truth that can be identified and that must be conserved. This living core, as they believed, stands revealed in Scripture, illumined by tradition, vivified in personal and corporate experience, and confirmed by reason. They were very much aware, of course, that God's eternal Word never has been, nor can be, exhaustively expressed in any single form of words.\nThey were also prepared, as a matter of course, to reaffirm the ancient creeds and confessions as valid summaries of Christian truth. But they were careful not to set them apart as absolute stan\u00ad dards for doctrinal truth and error.\nBeyond the essentials of vital religion, United Methodists respect the diversity of opinions held by conscientious persons of faith. Wesley followed a time-tested approach: \"In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; and in all things, charity.\"\nThe spirit of charity takes into consideration the limits of human understanding. \"To be ignorant of many things and to be mistaken in some,\" Wesley observed, \"is the necessary condition of humanity.\" The crucial matter in religion is steadfast love for God and neighbor, empowered by the redeeming and sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit."

    "text":"In this spirit, the British Methodists under the Wesleys never reduced their theology to a confessional formula as a doctrinal test. Methodism was a movement within the Church of England, and John Wesley constantly maintained that he taught the scrip\u00ad tural doctrines contained in the Thirty-Nine Articles, the Homi\u00ad lies, and the Book of Common Prayer of his national church. The Bible, of course, constituted for him the final authority in all doc\u00ad trinal matters.\nAs the movement grew, Wesley provided his people with published sermons and a Bible commentary for their doctrinal instruction. His Sermons on Several Occasions (1746-60) set forth those doctrines which, he said, \"I embrace and teach as the essen\u00ad tials of true religion.\" In 1755, he published Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament as a guide for Methodist biblical exegesis and doctrinal interpretation.\nAs occasional controversies arose, the need for a standard measure of Methodist preaching became evident. In 1763, Wesley produced a \"Model Deed\" for Methodist properties, which stipu\u00ad lated that the trustees for each preaching house were responsible for ensuring that the preachers in their pulpits \"preach no other doctrine than is contained in Mr. Wesley's Notes Upon the New Tes\u00adtament and four volumes of Sermons.\"\nThese writings, then, contained the standard exposition of Methodist teaching. They provide a model and measure for ade\u00ad quate preaching in the Wesleyan tradition. The primary norm for Wesley's writings was Scripture, as illumined by historic tradi\u00ad tions and vital faith. Wesley put forth no summary of biblical rev\u00ad elation for the British Methodists because the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England were already available.\nThe Wesley brothers also composed hymns that were rich in doctrinal and experiential content. The hymns, especially those of Charles Wesley, not only are among the best-loved within Meth\u00ad odism but also are major resources for doctrinal instruction.\nFurthermore, John Wesley specified various disciplines and rules, such as the General Rules, to implement in personal and communal life the practical divinity he proclaimed.\nIn addition to these writings, Wesley established the con\u00ad ference to instruct and supervise the Methodist preachers. He produced Minutes to ensure their fidelity to the doctrines and disciplines of the Methodist movement. These writings and struc\u00ad tures filled out the Wesleyan understanding of the church and the Christian life."

    "text":"As long as the American colonies were primarily under Brit\u00ad ish control, the Methodists could continue as part of the sacramen\u00ad tal community of the Church of England. The early conferences, under the leadership of British preachers, declared their alle\u00ad giance to the Wesleyan principles of organization and doctrine. They stipulated that the Minutes of the British and American con\u00ad ferences, along with the Sermons and Notes of Wesley, contained their basic doctrine and discipline.\nAfter the formal recognition of American independence in 1783, Wesley realized that the Methodists in America were free of English control, religious as well as civil, and should become an independent Methodist church. Wesley then furnished the American Methodists with a liturgy (The Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America) and a doctrinal statement (The Arti\u00adcles of Religion). The Sunday Service was Wesley's abridgment of the Book of Common Prayer; the Articles of Religion were his revi\u00ad sion of the Thirty-Nine Articles.\nThe American Methodist preachers, gathered at Baltimore in December 1784, adopted the Sunday Service and the Articles of Religion as part of their actions in forming the new Method\u00ad ist Episcopal Church. This \"Christmas Conference\" also accepted a hymnbook that Wesley had prepared (1784) and adopted a slightly modified version of the General Rules as a statement of the Church's nature and discipline. The conference spent most of its time adapting the British \"Large Minutes\" to American condi\u00ad tions. Subsequent editions of this document came to be known as the Doctrines and Discipline of the Methodist Episcopal Church (the Book of Discipline).\nThe shift from \"movement\" to \"church\" had changed the function of doctrinal norms within American Methodism. Rather than prescribing doctrinal emphases for preaching within a move\u00ad ment, the Articles outlined basic norms for Christian belief within a church, following the traditional Anglican fashion."

For generations, the Doctrines and Discipline cited only the Articles as the basis for test\u00ad ing correct doctrine in the newly formed church: The charge of doctrinal irregularity against preachers or members was for \"dis\u00adseminating doctrines contrary to our Articles of Religion.\" In this manner, the church protected its doctrinal integrity against the heresies that were prevalent at the time-Socinianism, Arianism, and Pelagianism (see Articles I, II, and IX).\nThe Articles of Religion, however, did not guarantee adequate Methodist preaching; they lacked several Wesleyan emphases, such as assurance and Christian perfection. Wesley's Sermons and Notes, therefore, continued to function as the traditional standard exposition of distinctive Methodist teaching.\nThe General Conference of 1808, which provided the first Con\u00ad stitution of The Methodist Episcopal Church, established the Arti\u00ad cles of Religion as the Church's explicit doctrinal standards. The first Restrictive Rule of the Constitution prohibited any change, alteration, or addition to the Articles themselves, and it stipulated that no new standards or rules of doctrine could be adopted that were contrary to the \"present existing and established standards of doctrine.\""

Other documents have also served American Methodism as vital expressions of Methodist teaching and preaching. Lists of recommended doctri\u00ad nal resources vary from generation to generation but generally acknowledge the importance of the hymnbook, the ecumeni\u00ad cal creeds, and the General Rules. Lists of such writings in the early nineteenth century usually included John Fletcher's Checks Against Antinomianism and Richard Watson's Theological Institutes. The doctrinal emphases of these statements were carried for\u00ad ward by the weight of tradition rather than the force of law. They became part of the heritage of American Methodism to the degree that they remained useful to continuing generations.\nDuring the great frontier revivals of the nineteenth century, the influence of European theological traditions waned in Amer\u00ad ica. Preaching focused on \"Christian experience,\" understood chiefly as \"saving faith in Christ.\" Among the Methodists there was a consistent stress on free will, infant baptism, and informal worship, which led to protracted controversies with the Presbyte\u00ad rians, Baptists, and Episcopalians, respectively.\nMethodist interest in formal doctrinal standards remained secondary to evangelism, nurture, and mission. The Wesleyan hymnody served in practice as the most important single means of communicating and preserving the doctrinal substance of the gospel.\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, Methodist theology in America had become decidedly eclectic, with less specific atten\u00ad tion paid to its Wesleyan sources.\nThe force of the Articles of Religion underwent several shifts. For a time, the first Restrictive Rule was exempted from the pro\u00ad cess of constitutional amendment, thus allowing no consider\u00ad ation of change in doctrinal standards. Mention of the Articles of Religion was included in the membership vows of The Methodist Episcopal Church, South."

    "text":"At the beginning of the twentieth century, however, the wan\u00ad ing force of doctrinal discipline and the decreasing influence of the Wesleyan theological heritage among the American Method\u00ad ists, along with minor but significant changes in the wording of the Book of Discipline regarding doctrinal standards, led to a steady dilution of the force of the Articles of Religion as the Church's constitutional standards of doctrine.\nDuring this same period, theologians and church lead\u00ad ers began to explore ways of expressing the gospel that were in keeping with developing intellectual currents. These leaders also began to rethink the historical social compassion of the Wesleyan tradition in the midst of the emerging industrial, urban civiliza\u00ad tion. They deepened our awareness of the systemic nature of evil and the urgency to proclaim the gospel promise of social redemp\u00ad tion. Consequently, theologies supportive of the social gospel found fertile soil within the Methodist traditions.\nThese years were times of theological and ethical controversy within Methodism as new patterns of thought clashed with the more familiar themes and styles of the previous two centuries.\nIn recent decades there has been a strong recovery of interest in Wesley and in the more classic traditions of Christian thought. This recovery has been part of a broad resurgence of Reformation theology and practice in Europe and America, renewing the his\u00ad torical legacy of Protestantism in the context of the modern world. These trends have been reinforced in North America by the reaf\u00ad firmation of evangelical piety. The ecumenical movement has brought new appreciation for the unity as well as the richness and diversity of the church catholic. Currents of theology have developed out of Black people's struggle for freedom, the movement for the full equality of women in church and society, and the quest for liberation and for indigenous forms of Christian existence in churches around the world. The challenge to United Methodists is to discern the vari\u00ad ous strands of these vital movements of faith that are coherent, faithful understandings of the gospel and the Christian mission for our times.\nThe task of defining the scope of our Wesleyan tradition in the context of the  contemporary world includes much more than formally reaffirming or redefining standards of doctrine, although these tasks may also be involved. The heart of our task is to reclaim and renew the distinctive United Methodist doctrinal heritage, which rightly belongs to our common heritage as Chris\u00ad tians, for the life and mission of the whole church today."

    "text":"The unfolding of doctrinal concerns among Jacob Albright's Evangelical Association and Phillip William Otterbein's United Brethren in Christ roughly parallels Methodist developments. Dif\u00adferences emerged largely from differing ecclesiastical traditions brought from Germany and Holland, together with the modified Calvinism of the Heidelberg Catechism.\nIn the German-speaking communities of America, Albright and Otterbein considered evangelism more important than theo\u00ad logical speculation. Although they were not doctrinally indiffer\u00ad ent, they stressed conversion, \"justification by faith confirmed by a sensible assurance thereof,\" Christian nurture, the priesthood of all believers in a shared ministry of Christian witness and service, and entire sanctification as the goal of Christian life.\nAs with Wesley, their primary source and norm for Christian teaching was Scripture. Otterbein enjoined his followers \"to be careful to preach no other doctrine than what is plainly laid down in the Bible.\" Each new member was asked \"to confess that he received the Bible as the Word of God.\" Ordinands were required to affirm without reserve the plenary authority of Scripture.\nMatched with these affirmations was the conviction that con\u00ad verted Christians are enabled by the Holy Spirit to read Scripture with a special Christian consciousness. They prized this principle as the supreme guide in biblical interpretation.\nJacob Albright was directed by the conference of 1807 to pre\u00ad pare a list of Articles of Religion. He died before he could attempt the task.\nGeorge Miller then assumed the responsibility. He recom\u00ad mended to the conference of 1809 the adoption of the German translation of the Methodist Articles of Religion, with the addition of a new one, \"Of the Last Judgment.\" The recommendation was adopted. This action affirms a conscious choice of the Methodist Articles as normative. The added article was from the Augsburg Confession, on a theme omitted in the Anglican Articles.\nIn 1816, the original twenty-six Articles were reduced to twenty-one by omitting five polemical articles aimed at Roman Catholics, Anabaptists, and sixteenth-century sectaries. This act of deletion reflected a conciliatory spirit in a time of bitter controversy.\nIn 1839, a few slight changes were made in the text of 1816. It was then stipulated that \"the Articles of Faith ... should be con\u00ad stitutionally unchangeable among us.\""

Its first three para\u00ad graphs follow the order of the Apostles' Creed. Paragraphs four and five affirm the primacy of Scripture and the universal procla\u00ad mation of \"the biblical doctrine ... of man's fall in Adam and his deliverance through Jesus Christ.\" An added section commends \"the ordinances of baptism and the remembrance of the Lord\" and approves foot washing as optional.\nThe first General Conference of the United Brethren in Christ (1815) adopted a slight revision of this earlier statement as the denomination's Confession of Faith. A further revision was made in 1841, with the stipulation that there be no further changes: \"No rule or ordinance shall at any time be passed to change or do away with the Confession of Faith as it now stands.\" Even so, agitation for change continued.\nIn 1885, a church commission was appointed to \"prepare such a form of belief and such amended fundamental rules for the gov\u00ad ernment of this church in the future as will, in their judgment, be best adapted to secure its growth and efficiency in the work of evangelizing the world.\"\nThe resulting proposal for a new Confession of Faith and Constitution was submitted to the general membership of the Church, the first such referendum on a Confession of Faith in United Brethren history, and was then placed before the General\nConference of 1889. Both the general membership and the confer\u00ad ence approved the Confession by preponderant majorities. It was thereupon enacted by episcopal \"proclamation.\" However, this action was protested by a minority as a violation of the Restrictive Rule of 1841 and became a basic cause for a consequent schism, resulting in the formation of The United Brethren Church (Old Constitution).\nThe Confession of Faith of 1889 was more comprehensive than any of its antecedents, with articles on depravity, justifica\u00ad tion, regeneration and adoption, sanctification, the Christian Sab\u00ad bath, and the future state. The article on sanctification, though brief, is significant in its reflection of the doctrine of holiness of the Heidelberg Catechism. The 1889 Confession was brought by the United Brethren into the union with the Evangelicals in 1946."

They are means of grace by which God works invis\u00ad ibly in us, quickening, strengthening and confirming our faith in him. Two Sacraments are ordained by Christ our Lord, namely Baptism and the Lord's Supper.\nWe believe Baptism signifies entrance into the household of faith, and is a symbol of repentance and inner cleansing from sin, a representation of the new birth in Christ Jesus and a mark of Christian discipleship.\nWe believe children are under the atonement of Christ and as heirs of the Kingdom of God are acceptable subjects for Christian Baptism. Children of believing parents through Baptism become the special responsibility of the Church. They should be nurtured and led to personal acceptance of Christ, and by profession of faith confirm their Baptism.\nWe believe the Lord's Supper is a representation of our redemption, a memorial of the sufferings and death of Christ, and a token of love and union which Christians have with Christ and with one another. Those who rightly, worthily and in faith eat the broken bread and drink the blessed cup partake of the body and blood of Christ in a spiritual manner until he comes."

Through faith in Jesus Christ this gracious gift may\nbe received in this life both gradually and instantaneously, and should be sought earnestly by every child of God.\nWe believe this experience does not deliver us from the infir\u00ad mities, ignorance, and mistakes common to man, nor from the possibilities of further sin. The Christian must continue on guard against spiritual pride and seek to gain victory over every temp\u00ad tation to sin. He must respond wholly to the will of God so that sin will lose its power over him; and the world, the flesh, and the devil are put under his feet.

They desired, as did two or three more the next day, that he would spend some time with them in prayer, and advise them how to flee from the wrath to come, which they saw continually hanging over their heads. That he might have more time for this great work, he appointed a day when they might all come together, which from thenceforward they did every week, namely, on Thursday in the evening. To these, and as many more as desired to join with them (for their number increased daily), he gave those advices from time to time which he judged most needful for them, and they always concluded their meeting with prayer suited to their sev\u00ad eral necessities.\nThis was the rise of the United Society, first in Europe, and then in America. Such a society is no other than \"a company of men having the form and seeking the power of godliness, united in order to pray together, to receive the word of exhortation, and to watch over one another in love, that they may help each other to work out their salvation.\"\nThat it may the more easily be discerned whether they are indeed working out their own salvation, each society is divided into smaller companies, called classes, according to their respec\u00ad tive places of abode. There are about twelve persons in a class, one of whom is styled the leader. It is his duty:\n1. To see each person in his class once a week at least, in order:\n        (1) to inquire how their souls prosper; (2) to advise, reprove, com\u00ad fort or exhort, as occasion may require; (3) to receive what they are willing to give toward the relief of the preachers, church, and poor."

Theology serves the Church by interpreting the world's needs and challenges to the Church and by interpreting the gospel to the world."

    "text":"Our theological task is both critical and constructive. It is critical in that we test various expressions of faith by asking: Are they true? Appropriate? Clear? Cogent? Credible? Are they based on love? Do they provide the Church and its members with a wit\u00ad ness that is faithful to the gospel as reflected in our living heritage and that is authentic and convincing in the light of human experi\u00ad ence and the present state of human knowledge?\nOur theological task is constructive in that every generation\nmust appropriate creatively the wisdom of the past and seek God in their midst in order to think afresh about God, revelation, sin, redemption, worship, the church, freedom, justice, moral respon\u00ad sibility, and other significant theological concerns. Our summons is to understand and receive the gospel promises in our troubled and uncertain times.\nOur theological task is both individual and communal. It is a feature in the ministry of individual Christians. It requires the participation of all who are in our Church, lay and ordained, because the mission of the Church is to be carried out by everyone who is called to discipleship. To be persons of faith is to hunger to understand the truth given to us in Jesus Christ.\nTheological inquiry is by no means a casual undertaking. It requires sustained disciplines of study, reflection, and prayer.\nYet the discernment of \"plain truth for plain people\" is not limited to theological specialists. Scholars have their role to play\nin assisting the people of God to fulfill this calling, but all Chris\u00ad tians are called to theological reflection.\nOur theological task is communal. It unfolds in conversations open to the experiences, insights, and traditions of all constituen\u00ad cies that make up United Methodism.\nThis dialogue belongs to the life of every congregation. It is fostered by laity and clergy, by the bishops, by the boards, agen\u00ad cies, and theological schools of the Church.\nConferences speak and act for United Methodists in their offi\u00ad cial decisions at appropriate levels. Our conciliar and representa\u00ad tive forms of decision-making do not release United Methodists as individuals from the responsibility to develop sound theologi\u00ad cal judgment.\nOur theological task is contextual and incarnational. It is grounded upon God's supreme mode of self-revelation-the incarnation in Jesus Christ. God's eternal Word comes to us in flesh and blood in a given time and place, and in full identification with humanity. Therefore, theological reflection is energized by our incarnational involvement in the daily life of the Church and the world, as we participate in God's liberating and saving action. Our theological task is essentially practical. It informs the individual's daily decisions and serves the Church's life and work. While highly theoretical constructions of Christian thought make important contributions to theological understanding, we finally measure the truth of such statements in relation to their practical significance. Our interest is to incorporate the promises\nand demands of the gospel into our daily lives.\nTheological inquiry can clarify our thinking about what we are to say and do. It presses us to pay attention to the world around us.\nRealities of intense human suffering, threats to the survival of life, and challenges to human dignity confront us afresh with fundamental theological issues: the nature and purposes of God, the relations of human beings to one another, the nature of human freedom and responsibility, and the care and proper use of all creation."

    "text":"As United Methodists, we have an obligation to bear a faithful Christian witness to Jesus Christ, the living reality at the center of the Church's life and witness. To fulfill this obligation, we reflect\ncritically on our biblical and theological inheritance, striving to express faithfully the witness we make in our own time.\nTwo considerations are central to this endeavor: the sources from which we derive our theological affirmations and the crite\u00ad ria by which we assess the adequacy of our understanding and witness.\nWesley believed that the living core of the Christian faith was revealed in Scripture, illumined by tradition, vivified in personal experience, and confirmed by reason.\nScripture is primary, revealing the Word of God \"so far as it is necessary for our salvation.\" Therefore, our theological task, in both its critical and constructive aspects, focuses on disciplined study of the Bible.\nTo aid his study of the Bible and deepen his understanding of faith, Wesley drew on Christian tradition, in particular the Patris\u00ad tic writings, the ecumenical creeds, the teachings of the Reform\u00ad ers, and the literature of contemporary spirituality.\nThus, tradition provides both a source and a measure of authentic Christian witness, though its authority derives from its faithfulness to the biblical message.\nThe Christian witness, even when grounded in Scripture and mediated by tradition, is ineffectual unless understood and appropriated by the individual. To become our witness, it must make sense in terms of our own reason and experience.\nFor Wesley, a cogent account of the Christian faith required the use of reason, both to understand Scripture and to relate the biblical message to wider fields of knowledge. He looked for con\u00ad firmations of the biblical witness in human experience, especially the experiences of regeneration and sanctification, but also in the \"common sense\" knowledge of everyday experience.\nThe interaction of these sources and criteria in Wesley's own theology furnishes a guide for our continuing theological task as United Methodists. In that task Scripture, as the constitutive wit\u00ad ness to the wellsprings of our faith, occupies a place of primary authority among these theological sources.\nIn practice, theological reflection may also find its point of departure in tradition, experience, or rational analysis. What mat\u00ad ters most is that all four guidelines be brought to bear in faithful, serious, theological consideration. Insights arising from seri\u00ad ous study of the Scriptures and tradition enrich contemporary\nexperience. Imaginative and critical thought enables us to under\u00ad stand better the Bible and our common Christian history."

    "text":"United Methodists share with other Christians the convic\u00ad tion that Scripture is the primary source and criterion for Chris\u00ad tian doctrine. Through Scripture the living Christ meets us in the experience of redeeming grace. We are convinced that Jesus Christ is the living Word of God in our midst whom we trust in life and death. The biblical authors, illumined by the Holy Spirit, bear wit\u00ad ness that in Christ the world is reconciled to God. The Bible bears authentic testimony to God's self-disclosure in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ as well as in God's work of creation, in the pilgrimage of Israel, and in the Holy Spirit's ongoing activity in human history.\nAs we open our minds and hearts to the Word of God through the words of human beings inspired by the Holy Spirit, faith is born and nourished, our understanding is deepened, and the pos\u00ad sibilities for transforming the world become apparent to us.\nThe Bible is sacred canon for Christian people, formally acknowledged as such by historic ecumenical councils of the church. Our doctrinal standards identify as canonical thirty-nine books of the Old Testament and the twenty-seven books of the New Testament.\nOur standards affirm the Bible as the source of all that is \"nec\u00ad essary\" and \"sufficient\" unto salvation (Articles of Religion) and \"is to be received through the Holy Spirit as the true rule and guide for faith and practice\" (Confession of Faith).\nWe properly read Scripture within the believing community, informed by the tradition of that community.\nWe interpret individual texts in light of their place in the Bible as a whole.\nWe are aided by scholarly inquiry and personal insight, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. As we work with each text, we take into account what we have been able to learn about the origi\u00ad nal context and intention of that text. In this understanding we draw upon the careful historical, literary, and textual studies of recent years, which have enriched our understanding of the Bible. Through this faithful reading of Scripture, we may come to know the truth of the biblical message in its bearing on our own lives and the life of the world. Thus, the Bible serves both as a source of our faith and as the basic criterion by which the truth and fidelity of any interpretation of faith is measured.\nWhile we acknowledge the primacy of Scripture in theological reflection, our attempts to grasp its meaning always involve tradi\u00adtion, experience, and reason. Like Scripture, these may become creative vehicles of the Holy Spirit as they function within the Church. They quicken our faith, open our eyes to the wonder of God's love, and clarify our understanding.\nThe Wesleyan heritage, reflecting its origins in the catholic and reformed ethos of English Christianity, directs us to a self\u00ad conscious use of these three sources in interpreting Scripture and in formulating faith statements based on the biblical witness. These sources are, along with Scripture, indispensable to our theological task.\nThe close relationship of tradition, experience, and reason appears in the Bible itself. Scripture witnesses to a variety of diverse traditions, some of which reflect tensions in interpretation within the early Judeo-Christian heritage. However, these tradi\u00ad tions are woven together in the Bible in a manner that expresses the fundamental unity of God's revelation as received and experi\u00ad enced by people in the diversity of their own lives.\nThe developing communities of faith judged them, therefore, to be an authoritative witness to that revelation. In recognizing the interrelationship and inseparability of the four basic resources for theological understanding, we are following a model that is present in the biblical text itself."

    "text":"The theological task does not start anew in each age or each person. Christianity does not leap from New Testament times to the present as though nothing were to be learned from that great cloud of witnesses in between. For centuries Christians have sought to interpret the truth of the gospel for their time.\nIn these attempts, tradition, understood both in terms of pro\u00ad cess and form, has played an important role. The passing on and receiving of the gospel among persons, regions, and generations constitutes a dynamic element of Christian history. The formula\u00ad tions and practices that grew out of specific circumstances con\u00ad stitute the legacy of the corporate experience of earlier Christian communities.\nThese traditions are found in many cultures around the globe. But the history of Christianity includes a mixture of ignorance, misguided zeal, and sin. Scripture remains the norm by which all traditions are judged.\nThe story of the church reflects the most basic sense of tradi\u00ad tion, the continuing activity of God's Spirit transforming human life. Tradition is the history of that continuing environment of grace in and by which all Christians live, God's self-giving love in Jesus Christ. As such, tradition transcends the story of particular traditions.\nIn this deeper sense of tradition, all Christians share a com\u00ad mon history. Within that history, Christian tradition precedes Scripture, and yet Scripture comes to be the focal expression of the tradition. As United Methodists, we pursue our theological task in openness to the richness of both the form and power of tradition.\nThe multiplicity of traditions furnishes a richly varied source for theological reflection and construction. For United Method\u00ad ists, certain strands of tradition have special importance as the historic foundation of our doctrinal heritage and the distinctive expressions of our communal existence.\nWe are now challenged by traditions from around the world that accent dimensions of Christian understanding that grow out of the sufferings and victories of the downtrodden. These tradi\u00ad tions help us rediscover the biblical witness to God's special com\u00ad mitment to the poor, the disabled, the imprisoned, the oppressed, the outcast. In these persons we encounter the living presence of Jesus Christ.\nThese traditions underscore the equality of all persons in Jesus Christ. They display the capacity of the gospel to free us to embrace the diversity of human cultures and appreciate their val\u00ad ues. They reinforce our traditional understanding of the insepa\u00ad rability of personal salvation and social justice. They deepen our commitment to global peace.\nA critical appreciation of these traditions can compel us to think about God in new ways, enlarge our vision of shalom, and enhance our confidence in God's provident love.\nTradition acts as a measure of validity and propriety for a community's faith insofar as it represents a consensus of faith. The various traditions that presently make claims upon us may contain conflicting images and insights of truth and validity. We examine such conflicts in light of Scripture, reflecting critically upon the doctrinal stance of our Church.\nIt is by the discerning use of our standards and in openness to emerging forms of Christian identity that we attempt to maintain fidelity to the apostolic faith.\nAt the same time, we continue to draw on the broader Chris\u00ad tian tradition as an expression of the history of divine grace within which Christians are able to recognize and welcome one another in love."

    "text":"In our theological task, we follow Wesley's practice of exam\u00ad ining experience, both individual and corporate, for confirma\u00ad tions of the realities of God's grace attested in Scripture.\nOur experience interacts with Scripture. We read Scripture in light of the conditions and events that help shape who we are, and we interpret our experience in terms of Scripture.\nAll religious experience affects all human experience; all human experience affects our understanding of religious experience.\nOn the personal level, experience is to the individual as tra\u00ad dition is to the church: It is the personal appropriation of God's forgiving and empowering grace. Experience authenticates in our own lives the truths revealed in Scripture and illumined in tradi\u00ad tion, enabling us to claim the Christian witness as our own.\nWesley described faith and its assurance as \"a sure trust and confidence\" in the mercy of God through our Lord Jesus Christ, and a steadfast hope of all good things to be received at God's hand. Such assurance is God's gracious gift through the witness of the Holy Spirit.\nThis \"new life in Christ\" is what we as United Methodists mean when we speak of \"Christian experience.\" Christian expe\u00ad rience gives us new eyes to see the living truth in Scripture. It confirms the biblical message for our present. It illumines our understanding of God and creation and motivates us to make sensitive moral judgments.\nAlthough profoundly personal, Christian experience is also corporate; our theological task is informed by the experience of the church and by the common experiences of all humanity. In our attempts to understand the biblical message, we recognize that God's gift of liberating love embraces the whole of creation.\nSome facets of human experience tax our theological under\u00ad standing. Many of God's people live in terror, hunger, loneliness, and degradation. Everyday experiences of birth and death, of growth and life in the created world, and an awareness of wider social relations also belong to serious theological reflection.\nA new awareness of such experiences can inform our appro\u00ad priation of scriptural truths and sharpen our appreciation of the good news of the kingdom of God.\nAs a source for theological reflection, experience, like tradi\u00ad tion, is richly varied, challenging our efforts to put into words the totality of the promises of the gospel. We interpret experience in the light of scriptural norms, just as our experience informs our reading of the biblical message. In this respect, Scripture remains central in our efforts to be faithful in making our Christian witness."

    "text":"Although we recognize that God's revelation and our experi\u00ad ences of God's grace continually surpass the scope of human lan\u00ad guage and reason, we also believe that any disciplined theological work calls for the careful use of reason.\nBy reason we read and interpret Scripture.\nBy reason we determine whether our Christian witness is clear.\nBy reason we ask questions of faith and seek to understand God's action and will.\nBy reason we organize the understandings that compose our witness and render them internally coherent.\nBy reason we test the congruence of our witness to the biblical testimony and to the traditions that mediate that testimony to us.\nBy reason we relate our witness to the full range of human knowledge, experience, and service.\nSince all truth is from God, efforts to discern the connec\u00ad tions between revelation and reason, faith and science, grace and nature, are useful endeavors in developing credible and commu\u00ad nicable doctrine. We seek nothing less than a total view of reality that is decisively informed by the promises and imperatives of the Christian gospel, though we know well that such an attempt will always be marred by the limits and distortions characteristic of human knowledge.\nNevertheless, by our quest for reasoned understandings of Christian faith we seek to grasp, express, and live out the gospel\nin a way that will commend itself to thoughtful persons who are seeking to know and follow God's ways.\nIn theological reflection, the resources of tradition, experi\u00ad ence, and reason are integral to our study of Scripture without displacing Scripture's primacy for faith and practice. These four sources-each making distinctive contributions, yet all finally working together-guide our quest as United Methodists for a vital and appropriate Christian witness."

    "text":"In addition to historic tensions and conflicts that still require resolution, new issues continually arise that summon us to fresh theological inquiry. Daily we are presented with an array of con\u00ad cerns that challenge our proclamation of God's reign over all of human existence.\nOf crucial importance are concerns generated by great human struggles for dignity, liberation, and fulfillment-aspirations that are inherent elements in God's design for creation. These concerns are borne by theologies that express the heart cries of the down\u00ad trodden and the aroused indignation of the compassionate.\nThe perils of nuclear destruction, terrorism, war, poverty, violence, and injustice confront us. Injustices linked to race, gen\u00ad der, class, and age are widespread in our times. Misuse of natural resources and disregard for the fragile balances in our environ\u00ad ment contradict our calling to care for God's creation. Secularism pervades high-technology civilizations, hindering human aware\u00ad ness of the spiritual depths of existence.\nWe seek an authentic Christian response to these realities that the healing and redeeming work of God might be present in our words and deeds. Too often, theology is used to support practices that are unjust. We look for answers that are in harmony with the gospel and do not claim exemption from critical assessment.\nA rich quality of our Church, especially as it has developed in the last century, is its global character. We are a Church with a distinctive theological heritage, but that heritage is lived out in a global community, resulting in understandings of our faith enriched by indigenous experiences and manners of expression.\nWe affirm the contributions that United Methodists of vary\u00ad ing ethnic, language, cultural, and national groups make to one another and to our Church as a whole. We celebrate our shared\ncommitment to clear theological understanding and vital mis\u00ad sional expression.\nUnited Methodists as a diverse people continue to strive for consensus in understanding the gospel. In our diversity, we are held together by a shared inheritance and a common desire to participate in the creative and redemptive activity of God.\nOur task is to articulate our vision in a way that will draw us together as a people in mission.\nIn the name of Jesus Christ we are called to work within our diversity while exercising patience and forbearance with one another. Such patience stems neither from indifference toward truth nor from an indulgent tolerance of error but from an aware\u00ad ness that we know only in part and that none of us is able to search the mysteries of God except by the Spirit of God. We proceed with our theological task, trusting that the Spirit will grant us wisdom to continue our journey with the whole people of God."

Christian unity is not an option; it is a gift to be received and expressed.\nUnited Methodists respond to the theological, biblical, and practical mandates for Christian unity by firmly committing our\u00ad selves to the cause of Christian unity at local, national, and world levels. We invest ourselves in many ways by which mutual recog\u00ad nition of churches, of members, and of ministries may lead us to sharing in Holy Communion with all of God's people.\nKnowing that denominational loyalty is always subsumed in our life in the church of Jesus Christ, we welcome and celebrate the rich experience of United Methodist leadership in church councils and consultations, in multilateral and bilateral dialogues, as well as in other forms of ecumenical convergence that have led to the healing of churches and nations.\nWe see the Holy Spirit at work in making the unity among us more visible.\nConcurrently, we have entered into serious interfaith encoun\u00ad ters and explorations between Christians and adherents of other living faiths of the world. Scripture calls us to be both neighbors and witnesses to all peoples. Such encounters require us to reflect anew on our faith and to seek guidance for our witness among\nneighbors of other faiths. We then rediscover that the God who has acted in Jesus Christ for the salvation of the whole world is also the Creator of all humankind, the One who is \"over all, through all, and in all\" (Ephesians 4:6).\nAs people bound together on one planet, we see the need for a self-critical view of our own tradition and accurate appreciation of other traditions. In these encounters, our aim is not to reduce doctrinal differences to some lowest common denominator of reli\u00ad gious agreement, but to raise all such relationships to the highest possible level of human fellowship and understanding.\nWe labor together with the help of God toward the salvation, health, and peace of all people. In respectful conversations and in practical cooperation, we confess our Christian faith and strive to display the manner in which Jesus Christ is the life and hope of the world."

Though we experience the wonder of God's grace at work with us and among us, and though we know the joy of the present signs of God's kingdom, each new step makes us more aware of the ultimate mystery of God, from which arises a heart of wonder and an attitude of humility. Yet we trust that we can know more fully what is essential for our participation in God's saving work in the world, and we are confident in the ultimate unfolding of God's justice and mercy.\nIn this spirit we take up our theological task. We endeavor through the power of the Holy Spirit to understand the love of God given in Jesus Christ. We seek to spread this love abroad. As we see more clearly who we have been, as we understand more fully the needs of the world, as we draw more effectively upon\nour theological heritage, we will become better equipped to fulfill our calling as the people of God.\nNow to God\nwho by the power at work within us\nis able to do far more abundantly\nthan all that we ask or think,\nto God be glory in the church\nand in Christ Jesus to all generations, for ever and ever.

The fulfill\u00ad ment of God's reign and realm in the world is the vision Scripture holds before us. The United Methodist Church affirms that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior of the world, and the Lord of all. As we make disciples, we respect persons of all religious faiths and we defend religious freedom for all persons. Jesus' words in Matthew provide the Church with our mission: \"Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey everything that I've commanded you\" (28:19-20), and \"You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your being, and with all your mind....You must love your neighbor as you love yourself\" (22:37, 39).\nThis mission is our grace-filled response to the Reign of God in the world announced by Jesus. God's grace is active everywhere, at all times, carrying out this purpose as revealed in the Bible. It is expressed in God's covenant with Abraham and Sarah, in the Exo\u00ad dus of Israel from Egypt, and in the ministry of the prophets. It is fully embodied in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is experienced in the ongoing creation of a new people by the Holy Spirit.\nJohn Wesley, Phillip Otterbein, Jacob Albright, and our other spiritual forebears understood this mission in this way. Whenever United Methodism has had a clear sense of mission, God has used our Church to save persons, heal relationships, transform social structures, and spread scriptural holiness, thereby changing the world. In order to be truly alive, we embrace Jesus' mandate to love God and to love our neighbor and to make disciples of all peoples."

In baptism, water is administered in the name of the triune God (specified in the ritual as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) by an authorized person, and the Holy Spirit is invoked with the laying on of hands, ordinarily in the presence of the con\u00ad gregation. In this sacrament the church claims God's promise and\nthe seal of the Spirit (Ephesians 1:13). Baptism is followed by nur\u00ad ture and the consequent awareness by the baptized of the claim to ministry in Christ placed upon their lives by the church. Such a ministry is confirmed by the church when the pledges of baptism are accepted through profession of faith, and renewed for life and mission. Entrance into and acceptance of ministry begin in a local church or extension ministry, but the impulse to minister always moves one beyond the congregation toward the whole human community. God's gifts are richly diverse for a variety of services; yet all have dignity and worth."

    "text":"The United Methodist Church, including its predecessor bod\u00ad ies, has a long and rich history of concern for social justice. Its members have often taken forthright positions on controversial issues involving Christian principles. In addition to carrying out acts of mercy, Methodism's founder, John Wesley, spoke out against the abuse of animals, the exploitation of poor people, and the treatment of human beings as chattel. Following in Wesley's footsteps, some early Methodists expressed their opposition to the slave trade, to smuggling, and to the cruel treatment of pris\u00ad oners. Similarly, the United Brethren strongly condemned slavery. In 1908, The Methodist Episcopal Church (North) was the first denomination to adopt a Social Creed, which called for \"equal rights and complete justice for all men in all stations of life.\" Within the next decade similar statements were adopted by The Methodist Episcopal Church (South) and by The Methodist Prot\u00ad estant Church. The Evangelical United Brethren Church adopted a statement of Social Principles in 1946 at the time of the uniting of The United Brethren and The Evangelical Church. In 1972, four years after the uniting in 1968 of The Methodist Church and The Evangelical United Brethren Church, the General Conference of The United Methodist Church adopted a new statement of Social Principles, which was revised in 1976 and by each successive Gen\u00ad eral Conference. In 2008, the General Conference added a Social\nCreed companion litany.\nThe Social Principles are not church law.1 Instead, they repre\u00ad sent the prayerful and earnest efforts of the General Conference to speak to issues in the contemporary world from a sound bibli\u00ad cal and theological foundation that is in keeping with the best of our United Methodist traditions. The Social Principles are thus a call to faithfulness and to social engagement and intended to be instructive and persuasive in the best of the prophetic spirit. Moreover, they challenge all members of The United Methodist Church to engage in deliberative reflection and encourage inten\u00ad tional dialogue between faith and practice.\nThe Social Principles are also a living document. In recogni\u00ad tion of the important changes that have taken place in The United Methodist Church over the past fifty years, including significant developments in Africa, Europe, and the Philippines, the 2012 General Conference mandated that the Social Principles be revised to increase their theological grounding, succinctness, and global relevance. To accomplish this task, the General Board of Church and Society initially sought input and advice through consulta\u00ad tions held in each of the five U.S. jurisdictions and a majority of the central conferences. The initial draft of the revised Social Principles was developed by six writing teams, whose members reflected the broad diversity of the church. Following this, an edi\u00ad torial revision team perfected additional drafts, based on feed\u00ad back received via online surveys, extensive consultations with central and annual conferences, and comments solicited from United Methodist scholars, bishops, church bodies, and leaders across the denomination."

    "text":"We, the people called United Methodists, affirm our faith in the living God, who created everything that is and called it good, and created human beings in God's own image. We give thanks for Jesus Christ, incarnation of God's love and our Savior, who redeems and heals our relationship with God. We trust in the movements of the Holy Spirit, transforming human lives and the whole creation. Further, we declare our faith that God's grace is available to all and \"nothing can separate us from God's love in Christ Jesus our Lord: not death or life, not angels or rulers, not present things or future things, not powers or height or depth, or any other thing that is created\" (Romans 8:38-39).\nFrom the beginning, God called us into covenant, bound with God, with one another, and with God's wonderfully diverse cre\u00ad ation. God called us, further, to live lovingly in those relation\u00ad ships and to be stewards of God's created world, to tend God's garden. As we do our part in caring for creation, we allow all other parts of creation to fulfill their distinctive roles in the cov\u00ad enantal relationship with God (Genesis 2:7-15). According to Jesus's commandment, we are to love one another: \"Just as I have loved you, so you also must love each other. This is how everyone will know that you are my disciples, when you love each other\" (John 13:34-35).\nCreated in God's image to live in covenant with God and the world, we honor the dignity of all beings and affirm the good\u00ad ness of life. Knowing that we are held in God's grace, we are able to confess our sins. We have failed to love God with our whole hearts, souls, minds, and strength, and to love our neighbors as ourselves. We have participated in unjust and life-destroying social systems. We have not been faithful stewards of God's cre\u00ad ation, nor have we valued the role that every part of creation plays in the flourishing of God's world. Further, we have not followed Jesus Christ in sharing God's extravagant love and ministering with \"the least of these\" (Matthew 25:45). We have closed our\u00ad selves to God's guiding Spirit in our daily interactions with the human family and the earth. We have fallen short, and yet God loves us still.\nWe are grateful for God's forgiving and sanctifying love, given to us and to all and drawing us toward perfect love. By God's grace, we are called to be more Christlike, and thus to be merci\u00ad ful, just, and compassionate. Responding to that call, we seek to follow Jesus, who gave boundless love to all-the children, the outcast, the condemned and the confused. Jesus calls every gen\u00ad eration to wholehearted discipleship: opening our hearts to the people we encounter daily; practicing compassion with our fami\u00ad lies and neighbors; honoring the dignity and worth of all people near and far; recognizing the systems that destroy human lives through poverty, war, and exclusion; and advocating justice and care in our churches, communities, and social structures. God calls us further to be stewards of creation, caring for the skies and waters, soil and plants, and all beings."

We recognize that the body of Christ has many parts, and all are valuable. Thus, we respect differences within Christ's body, including differences in under\u00ad standing and expressing faith, in gifts and practices of ministry, and in life experiences, as shaped by ethnicities, cultures, commu\u00ad nities, abilities, age, sexual orientation, and gender. We affirm our belief in the inestimable worth of each individual to whom God gives unique gifts. We renew our commitment to be faithful wit\u00ad nesses to the gospel in our daily lives and work and to magnify our witness as the church.\nDifferences are a precious gift and daunting challenge. They can stretch the church's capacity to live and minister faithfully. Yet God calls our church to difficult discipleship, with Jesus as our guide and the Spirit as our daily strength. With God's help, we accept the challenge to follow the high calling \"to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God\" (Micah 6:8 NRSV). John Wesley's General Rules continue to inspire United Methodists to faithful practices that will do no harm, do good, and follow the ordinances of God(, 104, \"The General Rules of the Methodist Church: The Nature, Design, and General Rules of Our United Societies\"). We recognize the challenges before the church to engage with honesty and compassion through deep lis\u00ad tening, hard conversations and shared ministry, even when we do not agree on all matters.\nWe acknowledge that the church is a living body gathered from the many and diverse parts of the human community. Thus, unanimity of beliefs, opinion, and practice have never been characteristic of the church from the beginning. From its earliest times, as witnessed in the Gospels, Paul's letters, the Acts of the Apostles, and other New Testament texts, diverse understandings and controversies on many matters have been the reality. There\u00ad fore, whenever significant differences of opinion occur among\nChristians, some of which continue to divide the church deeply today, faithful Christians need to face their disagreements and even their despair, and not cover differences with false claims of consensus or unanimity. On the contrary, the church needs to embrace conflicts with courage and perseverance as we seek together to discern God's will. With that understanding and com\u00ad mitment, we pledge ourselves to acknowledge and to embrace with courage, trust, and hope those controversies that arise among us, accepting them as evidence that God is not yet finished in sculpting us to be God's people.\nRecognizing that God is our Creator, Redeemer, and Sus\u00ad tainer, we seek to center our lives and witness on God. We are confident that nothing can separate us from the grace of God, and that the social witness of the church is a testimony to that grace. With God's help, we pledge to share ministry and honor every\u00ad one's dignity, even when we disagree, to seek the mind of Christ, and to follow God's will in all things."

    "text":"The great lesson that our blessed Lord inculcates here ... is that God is in all things, and that we are to see the Creator in the glass of every creature; that we should use and look upon nothing as separate from God... who pervades and actuates the whole created frame, and is, in a true sense, the soul of the universe. (John Wesley,\"Upon Our Lord's Sermon on the Mount\")\nWe affirm that all creation belongs to God and is a manifes\u00ad tation of God's goodness and providential care. Human beings, nonhuman animals, plants, and other sentient and non-sentient beings participate in the community of creation, and their flour\u00ad ishing depends on the care of all God's creation. Rather than treat\u00ad ing creation as if it were placed here solely for humanity's use and consumption, we are called to practice responsible steward\u00ad ship and to live in right relationship with the Creator and with the whole of God's creation (Genesis 1:26-31; Matthew 6:26-30; Romans 8:22-24). We are also called to honor the role of every part of creation in healing the whole; thus we praise God with the whole of creation (Psalm 148) and recognize that we are part of complex ecosystems, all valued by God.\nWe affirm our sacred calling to be responsible stewards and to lovingly tend all that God has wrought. We recognize the inherent worth of God's creation, celebrate earth's abundance and diver\u00ad sity, and, along with the entirety of the cosmos, give praise to its Creator. We recognize we are interconnected members of complex ecosystems, intricate webs of life, all of which have their origins in God's gracious act of creation."

To reverse the cur\u00ad rent trajectory of global climate change, increased investments are needed in the research, development, and distribution of alter\u00ad natives to fossil fuels, including, but not limited to, solar, wind, geothermal, and hydrogen-based energy sources. In pursuing alternatives to fossil fuels, it is critical to avoid solutions that would worsen current problems or create new, unforeseen environmental challenges. Reliance on nuclear energy, for example, raises considerable concerns regarding the safe stor\u00ad age and containment of radioactive waste.\nSimilarly, recent proposals to reduce the buildup of green\u00ad house gases by geo-engineering earth's biospheres, including its land, air, and water, risk unpredictable side effects and the fur\u00ad ther destabilization of the natural ecosystems on which all life depends.\nInevitably, transitioning from an overreliance on fossil fuels will have adverse impacts on individuals and communities whose livelihoods are still heavily dependent on the production, sale, and distribution of these commodities. To the greatest extent possible, plans for developing and deploying alternative sources of energy should minimize negative financial impacts by invest\u00ad ing in strategies that support people in successfully transitioning to new employment, strengthen the social safety net to deal with the loss of jobs and income, and provide ample educational and retraining opportunities."

Additionally, these groups suffer disproportionately from higher rates of asthma, cancer, birth defects, and other prevent\u00ad able medical conditions. These health problems are associated with pollutants and other chemicals in soil, water, and air that affect our drinking water, foods, and physical environment. We urge governments, businesses, and civic institutions to give prior\u00ad ity to increasing access to prevention and treatment services. We call for the institution of environmentally just principles, policies, and practices. We affirm the wisdom and agency of indigenous peoples and marginalized populations to determine for themselves practices and policies that best provide for their basic human needs, including food, water, shelter, and land free from toxic wastes. Self-determination entails, among other things, access to all pertinent information and significant decision-mak\u00ad ing power over industrial, agricultural, and other developments that have potential to wreak significant harm on land, air, and water."

Sustainable policies and practices prioritize the protection of all forms of life and natural ecosys\u00ad tems, while supporting human beings to live in healthy balance with the earth.

We reject agricultural policies and practices that make food inaccessible to agricultural workers and the communities in which the food is produced. We advocate for strong protections of the land, food, and water rights of indigenous peoples. We oppose the patenting of seed varieties and other organ\u00ad isms traditionally used in farming and agriculture. The rapidly expanding practice of patenting seed varieties and charging farmers for their use has reduced access to traditional crops and increased the indebtedness of subsistence and smaller-scale farms. Consequently, we support cooperative, open-source efforts aimed at making traditional seed varieties available to those who need them. We also call for the creation of policies that reduce carbon\u00ad intensive agricultural methods, which increase climate change. Producers must be responsible for their adverse impact on food packaging, distribution, and transport, and seek the safety and well-being of agricultural and food processing workers."

Globalization is marked by the growing integration of national economies and the emergence of multinational corporations that play an outsize role in global market systems. While globalization undoubtedly has provided certain finan\u00ad cial and other benefits, it has also undermined established wage and labor standards, weakened environmental protections, and accelerated the concentration of the world's wealth in the hands of a relative few. Additionally, globalization has increased over\u00ad consumption due to the ready access of cheaper goods and has undermined indigenous land rights in a rush to acquire raw mate\u00ad rials necessary for expanded production. As a church, we recognize the importance of creating just, equitable, and sustainable economies that benefit all members of society, especially marginalized and vulnerable peoples. Fur\u00ad ther, because globalization transcends the capacity of any single individual, community, or government to manage, we call on international bodies, including the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and oth\u00ad ers, to hold multinational corporations and national governments accountable to provide for economies that promote people over profits and protect the environment."

These monopolies raise significant concerns about the loss of local input and deci\u00ad sion-making power and accelerate the degradation of ecosystems, including soil, water and forests. Large agribusinesses, in particular, have exacerbated prac\u00ad tices that reserve the best lands for the exclusive production of exportable crops, rather than using those resources to feed local populations. They also have accelerated the depletion of the soil through monocultural farming, increased the release of methane gas by livestock, contributed to environmental degradation, and exposed workers to unsafe levels of pesticides and herbicides. We endorse measures that protect the continued operation of local, family, and communal farms and call for the elimination of government programs that disproportionately benefit large cor\u00ad porations and agribusinesses. We support efforts to restore local input and decision-making regarding the use of land, the produc\u00ad tion of crops, the raising of livestock, and the protection of local habitats in hopes that this will enable local communities to reap more of the benefits of farming and other forms of agricultural production.

    "text":"We believe in the dignity of work, not merely as a means of subsistence, but as a way for individuals to contribute to the flourishing of their families and contribute to the common good. This affirmation of the dignity of work leads us to support the right to safe and secure working conditions, free from health and safety hazards. We also endorse the establish\u00ad ment and enforcement of policies that guarantee workers fair and equitable compensation, sometimes referred to as a living wage. We recognize that full employment is a distant dream in many communities and cultures and, in such situations, the challenges in establishing workers' rights are significant. Still, the church advocates for the fair and decent treatment of workers and sup\u00ad ports policies that expand opportunities for more people to find meaningful work with just compensation and benefits. We oppose the widespread reliance on child labor, which forces children under the age of eighteen (18) to relinquish their childhoods and forgo educational opportunities, and instead to work in commercial agriculture, industrial manufacturing, or extractive industries. We support workers' freedom of association, including their rights to organize unions, to engage in collective bargaining, and to protest both unsafe working conditions and unjust employ\u00ad ment policies and practices. We also support workers' right to strike. We reject efforts to permanently replace workers engaged in strikes or to make organized work stoppages illegal. We support measures that limit the length of both the work\u00ad day and workweek and endorse policies that guarantee every worker paid time off, including but not limited to sick time and bereavement leave, opportunities to vote and carry out other civic duties, holiday or vacation time, and parental leave for those car\u00ad ing for newborns or newly adopted children."

It never waits to ask whether there is some good which is to be done; rather, before the ques\u00ad tion is raised, it has done the deed, and keeps on doing it. [One] who is not active in this way is a [person] without faith. (John Wesley, Preface, Explanatory Notes on Romans)\nThe gospel of Christ knows of no religion but social; no holiness but social holiness.

We live out our lives, grow in the faith, and engage in acts of discipleship and witness in the context of a variety of intercon\u00ad nected communities, including families, schools, neighborhoods, workplaces, and the broader society.\nThe church is called to be a distinctive community, marked by preaching of the gospel, studying of Scripture, breaking of bread, and witnessing to the power of redemption in the midst of a bro\u00ad ken world. We respond to God's call in the world by giving wit\u00ad ness to the transformative power of the gospel, engaging in acts of mercy, and striving toward the attainment of justice and peace as hallmarks of God's coming reign. In all of these efforts, Chris\u00ad tians are reminded that diverse as we may be, we are all a part of the same body under the sovereignty of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:12-31)."

    "text":"Within the church, we affirm marriage as a sacred, lifelong covenant that brings two people of faith, an adult man and woman of consenting age or two adult persons of con\u00ad senting age, into union with one another and into deeper relation\u00ad ship with God and the religious community. While The United Methodist Church does not recognize mar\u00ad riage as a sacrament, we celebrate and cherish this union as an expression of the couple's faith, grounded in their relationship with God and one another. Marriage thus reflects a continued willingness to grow together in Christ and a commitment to cul\u00ad tivate a covenantal bond that encompasses intimacy, grace, and love.\nAs members of the larger society, we also affirm the impor\u00ad tance of civil marriage, the legal recognition of domestic unions by the state. Such legal recognition is vital for guaranteeing family stability and the orderly regulation of inheritances, and for pro\u00ad viding assurance that spouses and children are afforded all the rights, benefits, and protections to which they are entitled. 1. Child Marriage - We reject marital relationships with children and youth under the age of eighteen (18), even in places where such relationships are culturally or legally permissible. Child marriages and premature sexual activities disrupt the nor\u00ad mal course of emotional, biological, and social development of minor children. For underage girls, in particular, premature sex\u00ad ual activities-and the pregnancies resulting from such activi\u00ad ties-can permanently damage internal organs, lead to lifelong medical problems, and preclude other opportunities in their lives. Waiting until a more appropriate age to wed offers better oppor\u00ad tunities for children and youth to grow into healthy adulthood and become full, contributing members of society. We therefore believe that young people should be of legal age to give their con\u00ad sent before entering into marriage. 2. Polygamy - We cannot endorse the practice of polyg\u00adamy, which entails living in relationship with multiple spouses. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that the forced dissolution of such relationships presents significant problems. All too often, the women and children forced out of polygamous relationships find themselves cast into abject poverty with no means of support. We, therefore, urge church leaders, when dealing with the dissolution of polygamous relationships, to exercise the utmost care and to prioritize considerations related to the continued health and well-being of dependent women and children. We reject attempts to ostracize families who are or have been in polygamous relationships, especially women and chil\u00addren, or deny them access to the ministries of the church, includ\u00ad ing participation in the sacraments. Instead, we urge pastors and congregations to extend the same gracious welcome and hospital\u00ad ity to all those in need. 3. Divorce - We recognize that divorce may become a regrettable but necessary alternative when marital relationships are strained beyond repair or become destructive or when spouses become irrevocably estranged. In such instances, we advise mar\u00ad ried couples to seek appropriate counseling and, if divorce pro\u00ad ceedings become unavoidable, to conduct them in a manner that minimizes detrimental impacts on all family members. Fidelity to the marriage covenant does not require spouses to remain in a physically or mentally abusive relationship. We do not support efforts to withhold the church's ministries from divorced people or to deny them opportunities for leadership in the church, whether clergy or lay. We urge pastors and congrega\u00ad tions to provide ministries and programs that support divorced people in overcoming social and religious stigmas that they too often face. Divorce does not preclude remarriage."

In responding to the widespread realities of substance abuse disorders, we begin with the recognition of the devastating impacts of addiction and of the misuse and abuse of legal and ille\u00ad gal substances in the lives of individual users, extended families and entire communities. In many parts of the world, opioid and other substance abuse has reached crisis proportions. The church supports programs and policies that comprehensively address the causes and cures of debilitating addictions. We call upon society to refrain from judging people who are addicted and upon governments at all levels to provide resources commensurate with the scope of the problem. In recognition of the devastation that substance abuse has wreaked on individuals, families and entire communities, we urge United Methodists to refrain from the use of any licit or illicit intoxicants, drugs, or other substances that foster addiction, impair mental faculties and physical abilities, and result in long\u00ad lasting damage to individuals, families, and communities. Regarding the consumption of alcohol, we acknowledge the historic United Methodist stance on abstinence as a safeguard against mental, physical, and spiritual harms caused by excessive drinking. Consequently, we urge those who choose to consume alcoholic beverages, including wine and beer, to do so wisely and in moderation. Another important consideration is the impact of such actions on those struggling to recover from alcohol use and abuse. Due to mounting medical evidence regarding the highly addictive nature and serious health consequences of direct or indirect ingestion or inhalation of nicotine and other chemicals found in commercial tobacco products, the church recommends complete abstinence. In making this recommendation, we recog\u00ad nize the difficulties in overcoming nicotine addiction and urge congregations to find ways to provide meaningful support to those who decide to stop using nicotine."

Colonialism refers to the practice of estab\u00ad lishing full or partial control of other countries, tribes, and peoples through conquest and exploitation. Neocolonialism continues the historic legacy of colonialism by maintaining economic, political, and social control of formerly colonized nations and peoples. Some of us belong to countries and groups that have richly benefited from the subjugation of whole peoples and from the sei\u00ad zure of lands and other resources. Others of us live in countries or are a part of communities that continue to struggle with the ongoing history and impacts of all forms of colonialism, including social, economic, and political instability; widespread malnutri\u00ad tion; illiteracy; disease; and continuing infringements on indig\u00ad enous and tribal lands. We recognize that far from being innocent bystanders, the church has often been deeply involved in colonialism and neo\u00ad colonialism. We, therefore, call on individuals and congregations to educate themselves about the troubling legacies of colonialism and, where appropriate, to seek repentance for our continued involvement. We urge United Methodists to find ways to sup\u00ad port those still suffering from colonial legacies, including tangible acts of reparation and active support for sustainable development initiatives."

    "text":"We recognize that every mortal life ends in death, and we affirm that God's abiding love and care remain with us as we transition from life to death to greater life. These affirmations, together with our expressed commitment to the sacred worth of every human being, lead us to insist that indi\u00ad viduals be treated with dignity and respect as they undergo the dying process. This emphasis on death with dignity means that the choices of individuals and families must be heard and respected, the use of medical technology must be measured and appropriate, and any unnecessary pain and suffering must be minimized. We affirm the right of people in the process of dying to participate actively in the decision-making process. As communities of faith, we are called to support individuals and families as they confront the realities of suffering and death. In sensitive and caring ways, we bear wit\u00ad ness to God's enduring love and grace, even when they cannot be felt or experienced in an immediate way. 1. Faithful Care of Dying People-Our approach to death and dying is framed by our belief in the inherent dignity and worth of human beings, our concern for patient autonomy, and the affirmation that our lives ultimately belong to God. Within this framework, we strongly support efforts to empower patients and their loved ones to make informed decisions about contin\u00ad ued treatment or end-of-life decisions that are consistent with applicable legal statutes and established medical protocols and standards. Such informed decision-making may lead patients and their loved ones to choose to continue treatments that hold the promise of significant health improvements or enhanced quality of life. Conversely, such decisions may also lead patients or loved ones to discontinue medical interventions that cease to be of sub\u00ad stantive benefit. We affirm the benefits of palliative care in instances where a decision is made to stop other treatments. Palliative care stresses the importance of making patients as comfortable as possible, minimizing pain and suffering, and allowing the dying process\nto proceed unhindered. We also endorse the creation of advance medical directives, which clearly express the preferences of patients should they become incapacitated and unable to advise their doctors. 2. Euthanasia and Suicide-Our conviction that life is a sacred gift, along with persistent questions and concerns about potential abuse, lead us as a church to oppose both euthanasia and suicide while continuing our ministries of mercy with fami\u00ad lies who are affected by such actions. Euthanasia, also known as mercy killing and physician-directed or physician-assisted sui\u00ad cide, occurs when doctors or other health professionals make lethal doses of medications available to terminally ill patients, or, in some cases, directly administer or supervise the taking of such medications. Suicide refers more generally to actions taken by indi\u00ad viduals to end their own lives. The motivations for suicide often involve depression and other forms of mental illness, including substance abuse. Worldwide, suicide attempts often occur after significant personal or familial crises, including the loss of liveli\u00ad hoods, forced migration and displacement, cultural oppression, and prolonged exposure to bullying and other acts of violence. While euthanasia or suicide cannot be condoned, we humbly confess the inadequacy of the church understanding and response. We urge congregations to educate themselves regarding the complex set of motivations and factors underlying these prac\u00ad tices. Recognizing that final judgment lies in God's hands rather than our own, we reject attempts to deny the ministries and ser\u00ad vices of the church to those who die by euthanasia or suicide or to their grieving families and other loved ones. We believe that suicide does not bar people from God's grace, which is all-sufficient. We urge pastors and local congrega\u00ad tions to establish appropriate protocols in responding to people considering suicide and the survivors of suicide attempts. Such protocols should include referrals to experienced counselors or medical professionals. Rather than ostracizing or condemning sur\u00ad vivors or family members affected by suicide, we urge pastors and congregations to provide compassion and support to these people."

We acknowledge that in some locales, First Nation, American Indian, and aboriginal peoples have opened gambling resorts and establishments as an act of self-determination and a crucial step toward economic survival. Rather than condemning such actions, we recognize that the church's role is to encourage dialogue and education regarding the hopes and aspirations of these communi\u00ad ties and to develop a deeper understanding of their histories and their continued quests for self-determination and survival. We vow to work toward the eradication of poverty and a more equitable distribution of financial benefits as a constructive strat\u00ad egy to reduce the financial appeal of organized gambling, which includes lotteries, casinos, and online games of chance.\n\n\n<pn>162<\/pn> <pt>III.

We regret that such prejudices have too often led to the denigration and dismissal of women's leadership and participation. Consequently, we reject any beliefs, policies or practices that envision women and men as unequal in either religious or secu\u00ad lar settings. We exhort congregations, pastors, boards of ordained ministries, bishops, and other church officials to implement con\u00ad crete efforts to nurture and promote the leadership of all people, regardless of gender.

We deplore the proliferation of hate speech across social media, broadcast and print news, and other platforms, and we call upon citizens and regulators to do all in their power to eliminate it. We also encourage individuals to take care when expressing their views on social media, recognizing the need for compassion and the harm that can be done to others when such compassion is lacking.

Further, we consider the buying and selling of organs and blood, including those obtained through theft and coercion, to be profound violations of the inherent dignity of human life and of moral precepts that dictate against human beings being treated as commodities. We urge governments and medical organizations to adopt laws and policies promoting organ donation while protecting vulnerable populations from abusive practices and ensuring that transplantable organs are equitably distributed regardless of a potential recipient's social standing."

    "text":"We support the provision of comprehensive, age-appropriate education for sexual health, as well as access to consistent, effective, and affordable contracep\u00ad tion. We also affirm ministries and initiatives aimed at promoting reproductive health and enhancing the quality of life for women and girls. Because of the dangers and risks involved in childbear\u00ad ing, we believe that women and girls should have consistent access to gynecological care. We, therefore, urge governments, businesses, churches, and other civic institutions to make access to prevention education, medical checkups, treatment, and coun\u00ad seling high priorities for women and girls of childbearing age. Our commitment to the sanctity of human life makes us reluctant to condone abortion. We unconditionally reject it as an acceptable means of birth control or a mechanism for gen\u00ad der selection and other forms of eugenics. We support measures requiring parental, guardian, or other responsible adult notifica\u00ad tion and consent before abortions can be performed on girls who have not yet reached the age of legal adulthood, except in cases of alleged incest. We oppose late-term or partial-birth abortion, a process also known as dilation and extraction. We call for the end to this prac\u00ad tice, except when the life of the mother is in danger, no other med\u00ad ical treatments are feasible, or when severe abnormalities threaten the viability of the fetus. We recognize that these and other tragic conflicts of life with life may justify decisions to terminate the life of a fetus. In these limited circumstances, we support the legal option of abortion and insist that such procedures be performed by trained medical providers in clean and safe settings. We urge all those considering abortions to seek appropriate medical advice and pastoral counseling and to engage in search\u00ad ing, prayerful inquiries into other alternatives, such as making babies available for adoption. We pray for those facing unin\u00ad tended pregnancies and offer our prayers and support as they attempt to discern God's will and seek God's wisdom and guid\u00ad ance. Regardless of the circumstances in which someone might get an abortion, we do not condone bullying or shaming people for their decisions or actions. We acknowledge that young women of childbearing age frequently report that they lack the ability to make meaningful life choices or exercise effective control over their own lives. We challenge pastors, congregations, campus ministries, and others to be at the forefront of efforts to empower these young women. Additionally, we support resource centers that offer compassion\u00ad ate care and help women explore alternatives to abortion. We recognize that access to reproductive health services is too often limited by economic factors. Women living in poverty are often unable to make choices about when to become pregnant or about the size of their families. They also lack access to safe pre\u00ad natal and postnatal care. Such a lack of agency perpetuates cycles of poverty by restricting the ability of women to participate in the workforce and by increasing the strain on scarce family resources. We support policies and programs that extend reproductive health services to women in economically challenged areas. We support the use of a variety of reproductive strategies for those desiring to have children, including fertility treatments, in vitro fertilization (IVF), embryo or sperm donation, surrogacy, and others. We believe the decision whether to use reproductive alter\u00ad natives is best left to those considering the use of these options, in consultation with their health care providers. In all instances, the use of reproductive alternatives should be in keeping with the highest ethical standards, prioritizing the health and well-being of both women and children."

    "text":"Recognizing the inherent worth and dignity of all people, we condemn sexual harassment, abuse, and assault and consider them grave viola\u00ad tions of the established behavioral norms within the church as well as our larger society. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome and inappropriate sexual remarks, gender-based remarks or physical advances made in workplaces, professional settings, or social situations. Sexual abuse or molestation entails unwanted sexual activ\u00ad ity perpetrated through the use of force or threats, or by taking advantage of those who are unable to give consent or those in vul\u00ad nerable situations with unequal power. Sexual assault includes all threats and forms of forcible sexual contact or bodily harm, including rape. We particularly deplore the sexual exploitation of children and youth and recognize that any sexual abuse is espe\u00ad cially heinous and damaging when it occurs in the context of the church. We urge pastors, congregations, and other church bodies to adopt clear policies and practices to prevent or address instances of sexual harassment. These policies and practices should include required training for all clergy and church staff, printed guide\u00ad lines on what constitutes sexual harassment, a safe and confiden\u00ad tial reporting method, and a clear process for resolving grievance complaints, including escalating penalties that end with the dis\u00ad missal of repeat offenders who fail to correct their behavior. We advocate the development and implementation of com\u00ad prehensive policies and practices in relation to cases of suspected sexual abuse and assault, especially when such cases involve minor children or others incapable of giving their consent. Even unsubstantiated reports of assault or abuse must be investigated immediately. Further, we urge pastors and congregations to com\u00ad ply fully with any legal statutes governing such matters and to be cognizant of any legal obligations as a mandated reporter."

    "text":"\"Love is the fulfilling of the law, the end of the commandment.\" Very excellent things are spoken of love; it is the essence, the spirit, the life of all virtue. It is not only the first and great command, but it is all the commandments in one. \"Whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are amiable,\" or honorable; \"if there be any virtue, if there be any praise,\" they are all comprised in this one word,-love. (John Wesley, \"The Circumcision of the Heart\"). Our involvement in political systems is rooted in the gospel imperative to love our neighbors, to do justice, and to care for the vulnerable. As United Methodists, we acknowledge that love requires responsible political action and engagement aimed at the betterment of society and the promotion of the common good. We acknowledge that such political engagement demands humility and mindfulness of our own complicity in perpetuating injustice. It also necessitates compassion, prayer, and a willingness to dis\u00ad cern God's guidance. We believe in the inherent worth of all people, which is estab\u00ad lished through God's gracious act of Creation and most fully revealed in the power of Jesus's life, death, and resurrection. The understanding that people are created in the image of God is a central theme in John Wesley's teachings. We further believe that God calls all members of the human family to recognize and protect the dignity and worth of all people and to work for the well-being of all God's creation. We, therefore, support structures in the church and in civil society that honor the basic freedoms and rights of all human beings and protect God's creation. In particular, we affirm the important work of the United Nations in promoting peace and security, championing human dignity and human rights, and advocating for sustainable development."

Though the formal relationships between religious com\u00ad munities and governments vary from country to country, we gen\u00ad erally affirm the independence and integrity of both institutions, and we advocate for a relationship of mutual respect in which nei\u00ad ther institution seeks to dominate or unduly influence the other. We affirm that every form of government stands under God's judgment and must therefore be held accountable for protecting the innocent, guaranteeing basic freedoms and liberties, protect\u00ad ing the natural world, and establishing just, equitable, and sus\u00ad tainable economies. We urge those elected or appointed to public posts or holding other positions in government to act as responsible leaders and stewards of the authority and resources entrusted to them. We call on all government officials to aspire to the highest standards of professionalism, honesty, and integrity. Furthermore, we urge all governments to adopt policies and practices that guarantee accountability and transparency in fostering and maintaining the trust of the public. We reject governmental use of threats, extortion, unlawful detentions, extrajudicial killings, and other forms of coercion to silence political opponents and those objecting to unlawful or immoral government policies and practices. In keeping with international laws and ordinances, we vehemently protest the use of torture, slavery, genocide, war crimes, crimes against human\u00ad ity, and crimes of aggression by any government and call for the strictest international sanctions to be imposed in such cases. While we do not believe churches should affiliate with par\u00ad ticular political parties, we do encourage churches to speak out boldly on social issues from a gospel perspective. We further believe churches have a right and a responsibility to educate and equip their members to be effective advocates for justice in the wider world."

When rela\u00ad tionships are violated or broken through crime or wrongdoing, such restoration is critically important. We, therefore, urge gov\u00ad ernments to develop systems that emphasize restorative justice, which requires people who have committed crimes to make amends for their offenses, and allows victims, if they elect to do so, to share with offenders how they have been harmed. Restor\u00ad ative justice seeks to prioritize the victim and the victim's family. It also seeks to repair damages, right wrongs, and bring healing to the victim, the offender, families, and the community. We urge congregations, governments, and businesses to sup\u00ad port diversion programs that allow those who have committed offenses to receive counseling, education, skills training, com\u00ad munity service, and other assistance to help them become fully contributing members of society. We encourage citizens to partner with law enforcement personnel in local communities to create alternatives to practices that emphasize retribution rather than restoration."

The death penalty is a sentence of execution imposed upon a legally convicted individual. Tragically, the death penalty compounds the loss of human life with the deliberate taking of another life. Additionally, the administration of the death penalty disproportionately impacts people who live in poverty, those who are uneducated, people who live in marginalized racial and ethnic communities, and people with mental impairments. Further, modern advances in technology have shown that a significant number of people are wrongly convicted of the crimes with which they have been charged. Such injustices call us to question the fair application of the death penalty and its congruence with the fundamental right to fair and equal treatment under the law.\nWe, therefore, call for the abolition of the death penalty and urge individuals and congregations to educate themselves about the historical stance of The United Methodist Church and its pre\u00ad decessors, especially The Evangelical United Brethren Church. Further, we ask pastors and congregations to commit themselves to minister to those who have lost loved ones to violent crimes and to support families without judgment as they navigate the competing demands of justice, compassion, and healing."

He bemoaned the deplorable conditions under which most prison\u00ad ers in his day lived. Claiming this heritage, we affirm the rule of law, the guarantee of civil liberties and rights, and equal access to justice for all people. We condemn discriminatory enforcement or any abuse of power for reasons of tribe, ethnicity, native lan\u00ad guage, country of origin, economic disadvantage, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or citizenship status. We encourage sys\u00ad temic monitoring for prejudice and bias in all criminal justice sys\u00ad tems. We further support access to competent legal representation for people who are accused and\/or convicted of criminal acts. We believe that offenders must be held accountable for crimi\u00ad nal actions, particularly those that result in a loss of life or liveli\u00ad hood, so we support measures that prevent, deter, or eliminate crimes, and set apart dangerous offenders. While insisting on accountability, we are also committed to fair and proportional sentencing and to the humane treatment of those who are impris\u00ad oned. We strongly support programs in prisons designed to pro\u00ad mote rehabilitation and restoration of inmates. We do not believe that prisons should be for-profit enterprises. In our communities, we support measures designed to address the root causes of crime, including poverty and the lack of educational opportunities, recreational activities, substance abuse treatment and counseling, mental health services, and job training. We endorse initiatives designed to promote positive interactions between law enforcement and members of local com\u00ad munities. Further, we encourage efforts to reintegrate people who have been released from prison back into the community, includ\u00ad ing the provision of employment opportunities, the restoration of voting rights, and, where appropriate, the sealing of criminal records. We encourage churches to be in ministry with those who are incarcerated, advocating for these people and for criminal jus\u00ad tice reform as well. As forgiven people, Christians must combat the stigma often attached to people who have been in prison. We applaud the involvement of many United Methodists in prison ministries centering on worship, education, and rehabilitation."

We yearn for the day when there will be no more war and people will live together in peace and justice. We reject the use of war as an instrument of foreign policy and insist that every peaceful and diplomatic means of resolu\u00ad tion be exhausted before the start of armed conflicts. Similarly, we oppose the increasing reliance on preemptive strikes unless they can be clearly demonstrated to be proportionate in response, delimited in human casualties, and undertaken in response to clear and immediate threats to human lives. We grieve that in a world where so many live in poverty, governments continue to dedicate enormous resources to preparing for and conducting wars. We are especially distressed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons and call not only for an end to their production, but for their complete elimination.\nChristians have struggled with the issue of war since the time of Jesus. Some Christians have argued historically that war and other acts of violence are never acceptable, while other believers have asserted that it is sometimes necessary to take up arms in self-defense or to defend the innocent and prevent unchecked aggression, tyranny and genocide. We urge all United Methodists to examine their own con\u00ad sciences and earnestly seek God's guidance when it comes to matters of military service. We honor and offer support to those who choose military service as a result of personal conviction and urge that they perform their duties in harmony with the tenets of the Christian faith and in accordance with the laws of the Geneva Conventions. We also honor and support the witness of pacifists whose consciences and religious convictions prevent them from serv\u00ad ing in the military or limit them to taking noncombatant roles. The roots of such pacifist convictions are well established in the historic stances of The United Methodist church and its predeces\u00ad sor bodies. We oppose compulsory military service and urge gov\u00ad ernments to abolish this practice and, instead, allow those who choose not to serve in the military to complete terms of commu\u00ad nity service or to contribute in other creative ways. As a church, we commit ourselves to support all people as they discern how best to model the nonviolent example of Jesus. The church supports and guides those who serve in the military; those who are conscientious objectors; veterans living with physi\u00ad cal, psychological, spiritual, and moral injury; and families of people affected by military service. We urge the church to care and work for systemic justice for all people affected by war, and to advocate for peacemaking and nonviolent conflict transformation in global and local conflicts."

We oppose all laws and policies that attempt to criminalize, dehumanize, or punish displaced individuals and families based on their status as migrants, immigrants, or refugees. Additionally, we decry attempts to detain displaced people and hold them in inhumane and unsanitary conditions. We challenge policies that call for the separation of families, especially parents and minor children, and we oppose the existence of for-profit detention cen\u00ad ters for such purposes."

Though no one term has gained universal acceptance throughout our global connection, \"people with dis\u00ad abilities\" refers to a broad group of people living with distinctive cognitive, physical, developmental, sensory, neurological, intel\u00ad lectual, and psychological conditions or challenges.\nWe lament that the church has often stigmatized and dis\u00ad criminated against people with disabilities by imposing labels with negative connotations, by failing to make space in church life for the full range of God's people, and by interpreting words such as \"blind,\" \"lame,\" and \"deaf\" in pejorative ways. Because of this, people with disabilities are frequently dismissed or under\u00ad valued, both in the church and in civil society. In response, we call the church to acts of repentance, to earnest listening, and to a collaborative ministry with people with disabilities so they can contribute their wisdom and gifts to the mission and ministry of local congregations and other church bodies. We likewise call on civil society, business, and government leaders to work toward the removal of all barriers and to provide opportunities for those with disabilities to make their unique con\u00ad tributions to the entire society. We call for the protection of the rights of all people with disabilities, including the rights to health care, employment, education, housing and transportation, and to freedom from discrimination."

A district may be divided into cluster groups for administrative purposes. (2) Probe Staff - composed of the pastors and other staff assigned to a geographic area to explore possibili\u00ad ties for cooperation and developing strategies for improving min\u00ad istry. (3) Group Ministry - a loosely organized group of two or more pastoral charges in which pastors are appointed or assigned to charges. The pastors and\/or laycouncil representing all churches may designate a coordinator. b) Structured Forms: (1) Multiple Charge Parishes - inten\u00adtionally organized group of two or more pastoral charges in which each church continues to relate to its charge conference on the orga\u00adnizational level and also participates in a parish-wide council. The pastors are appointed or assigned to the charges and also to the parish, and a director or coordinator is appointed or assigned by the bishop. (2) Larger Parish - a number of congregations working together using a parish-wide council and other committees and work groups, as the parish may determine which provides rep\u00ad resentation on boards and committees from all churches; guided by a constitution or covenant and served by a staff appointed or assigned by the bishop and involving a director. (3) Blended Min\u00adistry - the merging of the organizations and memberships of churches spread throughout a defined geographical area into one congregation that intentionally develops two or more worship\/ program centers, and for which there is one charge conference and one set of committees and other groups, guided by a cov\u00ad enant and served by a staff and a director appointed or assigned to the parish by the bishop. c) Specialized Forms: (1) Enlarged Charge - two or more congregations, usually on the same charge and of relatively equal size that work as a unit with the leadership of one or more pas\u00ad tors. There may be a charge council and appropriate committees. (2) Extended or Shared Ministry - a larger membership church shar\u00ad ing ministry with a smaller membership church, usually served by the pastor(s) of the larger church. (3) Cooperative Ecumenical Par\u00adish - two or more local churches of different Christian traditions including a United Methodist congregation, working together. Either of the above forms may be utilized. (4) Shared Facilities - two or more congregations, one of which shall be United Methodist, sharing a building, office equipment, etc., such as congregations which use different languages or which are of different racial\/ eth\u00adnic\/cultural groups. The congregations may enter into a covenant that ensures representation and preserves the autonomy of each congregation on such bodies as church councils, boards of trust\u00ad ees and other committees and work groups. The congregations may negotiate a financial agreement about the use of the facility in order to provide appropriate financial support."

The church draws new people into itself as it seeks to remain faithful to its commission to proclaim and exemplify the gospel. Baptism is the sacrament of initiation and incorporation into the body of Christ. After bap\u00ad tism, the church provides the nurture that makes possible a com\u00ad prehensive and lifelong process of growing in grace. Becoming a professing member requires the answer of faith of the baptized person made visible in a service of profession of Christian faith and confirmation using the vows of the baptismal covenant. a) Baptized infants and children are to be instructed and nurtured in the meaning of the faith, the rights and responsibilities of their baptism, and spiritual and moral formation using materi\u00ad als approved by The United Methodist Church. Using the services of the baptismal covenant, youth will profess their faith, commit themselves to a life of discipleship, and be confirmed. Confirma\u00ad tion is both a human act of commitment and the gracious action of the Holy Spirit strengthening and empowering discipleship. b) Youth and adults who have not been baptized and who are seeking to be saved from their sins and profess Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior are proper candidates for baptism in The United Methodist Church. It shall be the duty of the congregation, led by the pastor, to instruct them in the meaning of baptism, in the meaning of the Christian faith, and in the history, organiza\u00ad tion, and teachings of The United Methodist Church, using mate\u00ad rials approved by The United Methodist Church for that purpose. After the completion of the period of nurture and instruction, the sponsor(s) and pastor shall bring the candidates before the congregation and administer the services of Baptismal Covenant, in which people are baptized, confirmed, and received into the Church.\n2. a) Formation in the baptismal covenant and in the call to ministry in daily life is a lifelong process and is carried on through all the activities that have educational value. The pastor gives spe\u00ad cific leadership that prepares youth for their profession of faith and commitment to discipleship and for the Holy Spirit's action\nconfirming them in their faith and empowering their discipleship. This preparation focuses attention upon the meaning of disciple\u00ad ship and the need for members to be in mission in all of life's relationships. b) There are many occasions as people mature in the faith when the Holy Spirit's confirming action may be celebrated, such as in the reaffirmation of the baptismal covenant or other services related to life passages. Unlike baptism, which is a once-made covenant and can only be reaffirmed and not repeated, confirma\u00ad tion is a dynamic action of the Holy Spirit that can be repeated.\n3. Preparation for the experience of profession of faith and confirmation shall be provided for all people, including adults. Youth who are completing the sixth grade shall normally be the youngest people recruited for such preparation. When younger people, of their own volition, seek enrollment in preparation for profession of faith and confirmation, such preparation shall be at the discretion of the pastor."

Youth who are members of the Church have all rights and responsibilities of membership within the baptismal cov\u00ad enant. (See 1 256.3.) It is strongly recommended that each local church offer for all senior high youth continuing instruction in the meaning of the Christian life and discipleship. It is further rec\u00ad ommended that this course, taught by or under the guidance of the pastor, or other staff or layperson, emphasize the doctrines of The United Methodist Church and the nature and mission of the Church, leading to continued growth in the knowledge, grace, and service of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Program of Religious Activi\u00ad ties with Youth (P.R.A.Y.) program may be available to all youth, with the God and Church portion providing study of The United Methodist Church, and the God and Life program challenging the youth to integrate their faith into their daily life. It shall be the responsibility of the pastor to participate in the growth pro\u00ad cess through interaction and ministry with youth."

It shall visit the member and make clear that, while the member's name is on the roll of a particular local church, one is a member of The United Methodist Church as a whole, and that, since the member is not attending the church where enrolled, the member is requested to do one of four things: (a) reaffirm the baptismal vows and return to liv\u00ad ing in the community of the baptismal covenant in the church where the member's name is recorded, (b) request transfer to another United Methodist church where the member will return to living in the community of the baptismal covenant, (c) arrange transfer to a particular church of another denomina\u00adtion, or (d) request withdrawal. If the member does not comply with any of the available alternatives over a period of two years, the member's name may be removed. (See (4) below.) (2) If a professing member whose address is known is residing outside the community and is not participating in the worship or activity of the church, the directives to encourage a transfer of the member shall be followed each year until that member joins another church or requests in writing that the name be removed from the roll of professing members; provided, how\u00ad ever, that if after two years the council has not been able to relate that member to the church at the new place of residence, the name may be removed from the roll of members by the procedure of (4) below. (3) If the address of a professing member is no longer known to the pastor, the membership secretary and the evange\u00ad lism ministry group chairperson shall make every effort to locate the member. If the member can be located, the directives of either (1) or (2) above shall be followed, but if after two years of such efforts the address is still unknown, the member's name may be removed from the roll of members by the procedure of (4) below. (4) If the directives of (1), (2), or (3) above have been followed for the specified number of years without success, the member's name may be removed as a professing member by vote of the charge conference on recommendation of the pastor and the evangelism ministry chairperson, each name being con\u00ad sidered individually, provided that the member's name shall have been entered in the minutes of the annual charge conference for two consecutive years. On the membership record there shall be entered after the name:\"Removed by Charge Conference Action\"; and if the action is on the basis of (3), there shall be added: \"Rea\u00adson: Address Unknown.\" The record shall be retained in order that upon reaffirmation of the baptismal covenant the person may be restored as a member. Should a transfer of membership be requested, the pastor may, after consultation with the person, issue the certificate of transfer. (5) A written complaint or grievance may be filed against a professing member by serving the complaint or griev\u00ad ance on the professing member, the pastor of the professing mem\u00ad ber, and the district superintendent of the professing member. (6) The pastor and district superintendent of the accused professing member shall attempt a just resolution pro\u00ad cess similar to the supervisory response with the professing member's district superintendent or designee leading the process. (7) If the  procedures of \u00b6 363.l(b, c) do not result in resolution of the matter and if the conduct alleged in the com\u00adplaint or grievance, if true, would be a chargeable offense found in \u00b6 2702.3, then the procedures of \u00b6 2701 and following para\u00adgraphs are to be followed unless the accused professing member agrees to use the procedure described in \u00b6 228.2b (8) below. (8) If the procedures of \u00b6 363.l(b, c) do not result in resolution of the matter and if the conduct alleged in the com\u00adplaint or grievance, if true, would not be a chargeable offense found in \u00b6 2702.3, then a group of four persons: the pastor of the accused professing member, the lay leader of the accused pro\u00adfessing member's church, the district lay leader, and the district superintendent, ex officio, without vote but with voice, where the accused professing member's church is located, shall hear infor\u00ad mation from the accused professing member and the complainant or grievant and shall determine an unappealable resolution of the matter. (9) When a professing member is charged with an offense and wishes to forego trial, the charge conference may per\u00ad mit the member to withdraw (\u00b6 2720.3). In this case, the notation \"Withdrawn under charges\" shall be entered alongside the mem\u00ad ber's name on the record, along with the date. (10) Recognizing that the Church has a continuing moral and spiritual obligation to nurture all persons, it is recom\u00ad mended that a list of names thus removed shall be maintained. It shall then become the responsibility of the church council to pro\u00advide for the review of this list at least once a year. (See also \u00b6 234.). After the review has been made, it is recommended that the pas\u00ad tor and\/or the commission on evangelism contact those whose names appear on this list, either in person or by other means, in the most effective and practical manner. The names and addresses of those who have moved outside the local church's area should be sent to local churches in their new communities that those churches may visit and minister to them."
